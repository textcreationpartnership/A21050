            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſaith; That man is ſaid to be <hi>Benigne,</hi> who doth good with a good will, and vſeth ſweetnes in his wordes. And Saint
<hi>Anſelmus,</hi> declaring what <hi>Benignity</hi> is, ſaith
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23762:9"/>thus; <hi>Benignity</hi> is a good affection of the will, &amp; a ſerenity of heart; in vertue whereof a man doth, for Gods ſake giue all he can, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a gratious and cheerfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and diſcourſeth and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth gently, and ſweetly with his neighbours. And Saint
<hi>Thomas,</hi> explicating the nature of <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ſaith, that it is the very ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; tendernes of <hi>Charity</hi> which ſpreads, &amp; communicates it ſelf exteriourly; &amp; that as natural fier doth melt mettel, &amp; make it flow; ſo the fier of loue, which is
<hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> maketh a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcatter what he hath towards the ſuccour of the neceſſities of his neighbours.</p>
            <p>This is that, which the Saints ſay of <hi>Benignity,</hi> and the ſumme of it all is this: that it is the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Charity,</hi> which doth not only communicate a mans exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour goods to his neighbour, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23762:10"/>together with them, it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his owne very bowells; which is, to diſcouer both by wordes, and workes, the dearnes &amp; ſweetnes of <hi>Charity.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle declareth this, by ſaying,
<hi>Charity is Benigne.</hi> Which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that it makes the man who poſſeſſeth it, not to be ſtraight handed, but apt to communicate his goods; and not to be harſh or bitter; but that he communicate euen his very hart by conuerſing with all men after an affable and ſweet manner. And to giue vs to vnderſtand this truth, the holy Scripture, doth by one &amp; the ſelfe ſame Hebrew, and Greeke word, which ſignifieth <hi>Benignity</hi> in doing good, ſignify alſo a ſoftnes, and ſweetnes in the manner of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy. And ſo, whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>Our Lord is sweet towards all,</hi> another letter ſaith, <hi>Our Lord is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23762:10"/>benigne towards all.</hi> And whereas he ſaith, <hi>That ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is gentle, &amp; sweet, who sheweth mercy;</hi> another tranſlation ſaith; <hi>The man who sheweth mercy, is Benigne.</hi> And therfore S.
<hi>Baſil,</hi> when he would explicat what it was, for a man to be
<hi>Benigne,</hi> ſaith; that it is he, who doth liberally enlarge himſelfe to doe good to all ſuch as are in neceſſity. And he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it by that Pſalme which ſaith, <hi>Our Lord is benigne towards all;</hi> and by that other, which alſo ſaith, <hi>That a man is Benigne, who sheweth mercy,</hi> and imparteth his goods to ſuch as are in neceſſity.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Benignity</hi> did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord inſtruct vs, and perſwade vs to it, by many examples, &amp; My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of his holy life which wee wil e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deauour to declare. The firſt and principall Myſtery, wherein he diſcouered his <hi>Benignity,</hi> was that of his
<hi>Incarnation.</hi> In that, the <pb n="8" facs="tcp:23762:11"/>moſt high ſonne of God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to become a naturall man, &amp; to appeare viſibly in the world in mortall fleſh, obnoxious to the miſeries and penalties of other men; and in that he did all this, to doe good to man; and to draw him to his loue, and ſo to ſaue him; not onely did he diſcouer an immenſe loue towards vs, but a loue which was alſo moſt ſweet and dear. And not onely did he communicate his bleſſings to vs, but he alſo did it with ſupreme li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and guſt, and ioy of his owne ſacred heart. And together with his bleſſings, he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to vs, his very ſelfe; namly his body, his blood, his bleſſed ſoule, and his diuinity; and all that which he hath, yea and euen all that which he is, he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to vs, by many admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; myſterious waies. This did <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23762:11"/>the Apoſtle ſignify by ſaying; Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the time of grace, the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity</hi> &amp; imme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe loue of our God and Sauiour to man, did manifeſt it ſelfe to the world, he ſaued and freed vs from our ſinnes, not by the title of Iuſtice, and the merit of our workes, (which were not of any valew without
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, for the arriuing to that end;) but through his owne great mercy, and moſt gratious bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, and by meanes of that ſacred La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatory, which is holy Baptiſme, whereby wee are engendred a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to be the ſonnes of God, and renewed by a ſpirituall generation, &amp; renouation, which is wrought by the holy Ghoſt; which Holy Ghoſt, the eternall Father hath by meanes of his gifts and graces infuſed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to vs in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, through the merits of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> 
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:23762:12"/>our Lord, to the end that being iuſtified through the grace of the ſame Lord, wee might from this inſtant become heires of eternall life, which now wee hould by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope, and which hereafter wee ſhall haue in actuall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This is deliuered by Saint <hi>Paule.</hi> And Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> vpon theſe words, declaring that <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of God which was diſcouered in this Myſtery diſcourſeth thus. Before the humanity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord appeared in the word the <hi>Benignity</hi> of God was hidden from vs. There was already in God this <hi>Benignity,</hi> &amp; mercy, which in him is eternall; but ſo great <hi>Benignity</hi> as this, was not knowen before, nor was there any meanes how to to know it. And although it were promiſed by the Prophets, yet men vnderſtood it not, and felt it not, and many did not ſo much <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23762:12"/>as beleeue it. But when that time arriued, which had been ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the diuine wiſedome, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God came in mortall fleſh, and being veſted with his ſacred <hi>Humanity,</hi> and appearing to the eyes of our fleſh &amp; blood, his <hi>Benignity</hi> came to be made knowne; for by no meanes could he more haue manifeſted his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> then by taking our fleſh; and by no meanes could he more haue declared his mercy, then by vndertaking our miſery. Let ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſider, and vnderſtand from hence, how great care God hath of him; and how much he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him; and for how mighty an end he made him; ſince he did, and ſuffered ſo great thinges for him. And thus, by this <hi>Humanity</hi> wee may know his
<hi>Benignity;</hi> for how much the leſſe he became by his
<hi>Humanity,</hi> ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <pb n="12" facs="tcp:23762:13"/>doth he ſhew himſelfe to be in bounty; and by how much the more he abaſed himſelfe for vs, ſo much the more amiable doth he ſhew himſelf to vs. This is ſaid by Saint <hi>Bernard;</hi> and ſo it is a moſt clear truth, that nothing hath made ſo great diſcouery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o vs of the bounty, and <hi>Benignity</hi> of God, nor hath moued &amp; obliged vs ſo to loue and praiſe him, as for that he hath taken our
<hi>Humanity.</hi> And therfore as Dauid ſaith, <hi>giue praiſe to God, becauſe he is benigne and good; and ſing praiſes to his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is sweet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord did alſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to vs his
<hi>Benignity,</hi> after a moſt ſoueraigne ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, in the Miſtery of his moſt holy <hi>Natiuity.</hi> For what loue can be imagined more dear? &amp; what communication of ones felfe more a morous? &amp; what dew of heauen more abundant, and <pb n="13" facs="tcp:23762:13"/>more ſweet, then to ſee <hi>that hidden God,</hi> that <hi>God of vengeance, that God of thoſe Celeſtiall Hostes,</hi> that <hi>Iudge of the quicke and dead,</hi> that <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in his workes,</hi> and that <hi>Terrible in his iudgments?</hi> to ſee him I ſay, become a tender and delicate lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Infant, hanging cloſe vpon the breſts of a Virgin; all burning in loue, &amp; all expiring the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and dearnes of the ſame loue towards vs? And that he comes to vs, not as anciently he came to the children of Iſraell in Mount Horeb, with thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and with the terrible ſound of the trumpet, and with huge flames of materiall fier; and with prohibition that no man ſhould approach to the foot of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vpon paine of death: but that he ſhould come to be borne an Infant, and appeare on earth, with a moſt clear, and ſweet light
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23762:14"/>from heauen, to diſcouer him and with moſt delightful ſonges, and exultation of Angells; who being full of ioy, <hi>ſing Glory to God, and peace to men.</hi> And that inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly then, he ſhould recreate, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thoſe poore ſhepheards with an Embaſſage performed by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells; and ſhould inuite them to come viſit him, and to receiue the comfort of his preſence, and to be enriched with the gifts of grace through his goodnes. And that by his loue, and humility, and meeknes, and ſweetnes, he ſhould encourage all men to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards him; and to come to him by faith and obedience; and ſo to take their part of all the riches and benedictions of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for being the ſonne of the eternall Father, <hi>be came full of grace and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo diſcouered his <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> 
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:23762:14"/>to vs, in the vocation of the <hi>Magi,</hi> that firſt flower of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whom he meant to call in after times. He calls them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as ſoon as he was borne, and he ſent no Prophet for them, nor any Angell; for they had no knowledge of Prophets, &amp; they were not wont to ſee Angells, and ſo they might haue rather been eſtranged by ſuch vnuſuall inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but condeſcending to their condition and cuſtome, he ſent them a ſtarre, which by the nouelty thereof might moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a kinde of admiration; and to a ſearch of what it might meane; and by the ſecret vertue thereof might be teaching them withall, that if ſignified the birth of the new Kinge; and he admoniſhed and inuited them to ſeeke him, by following that ſtarre, &amp; he gaue them courage not to feare the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23762:15"/>
               <hi>Herod;</hi> and he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith and deuotion to know, that the Infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whom they ſaw new borne, was the eternall God; that ſo they might dedicate themſelues to do him eternall ſeruice, as to the Kinge and Lord of heauen and earth, whom they ſaw in ſo great pouerty and contempt, for as much as concerned the world.</p>
            <p>All this is the ſupreme <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and moſt ſweet dear loue of God towards man; and it inuites vs to ſeeke him; and if wee haue offended him, to confide, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our ſinnes, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon of him; and that he will receiue vs, to his grace and loue. For now, when he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcouered his great <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to vs; by his ſacred <hi>Humanity;</hi> with more reaſon doth he ſay, that to vs, which ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly he ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> be you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

            <p>AFter our Lord had begun to manifeſt himſelfe in Iſraell, and to conuerſe with men, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and exerciſed his

This man <pb n="22" facs="tcp:23762:18"/>coming to <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord with ſo imperfect a faith, and with ſo meane a conceit of the power of our Lord, as to thinke that it would be neceſſary for the health of his daughter, that he muſt goe to his houſe, &amp; lay his hand vpon her, not beleeuing that he could cure her without theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; yet notwithſtanding all this, our Lord receiued him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with him after ſo ſweet a manner, and ſhewed himſelfe ſo affable to him, that he diſſembled the ſeeing of all theſe defects; and he reproued him not for them, leaſt he ſhould haue grieued him by his wordes, whereas he ment to cure him by his workes. Nor did he deny that which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked; nor did he differre the doing of it; but inſtantly he roſe vp, and went with him, and graunted not onely that which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23762:18"/>he asked, but a great deale more. For he raiſed his dead daughter to life in body, and he alſo gaue health to her ſoule, by making her beleeue firmely in him, vpon the ſight of ſo great a miracle, and he moued and obliged him, to doe him ſeruice with deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for ſo ſingular a benefit.</p>
            <p>This was an act of great <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and ſo did Saint

And yet our Lord, not looking vpon the vnworthines of him who asked the benefit, did with much facility and ſuauity grant his ſuite, going preſently to his houſe, to doe the thing which he deſired, and much more then he deſired. For he reſolued to raiſe <pb n="24" facs="tcp:23762:19"/>her from death to life; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to giue a firme hope of the Reſurrection to them, who ſawe, and beleeued that miracle.</p>
            <p>Let vs be hould other examples of the ſame kinde of

<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. There came a Samaritan woman to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſhe were a creature of very baſe condition, and of more baſe life; and a Gentile by deſcent, and extreamely rude in matters which concerned Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and ſpirit, yet he inuited her to haue ſpeech with him, himſelfe beginning the diſcourſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring water of her, whereof he knew he would not drinke; and he fell into a moſt ſweet and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable communication with <pb n="25" facs="tcp:23762:19"/>her, and he made her a very long Sermon, full of Myſteries, and he paſſed by the rudenes both of her queſtions and anſweres; and he condeſcended to her ignorance; and he accommodated himſelfe to her weakenes; and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of corporall thinges taught her things which were ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; and by meanes of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall water, he aduanced her to the vnderſtanding of the value, and effects of the water of grace. And he went inſtructing her by little and little; diſcouering to her firſt that he was a Prophet, and teaching her afterward, how ſhe was to honour one only God, with ſpirituall and true worſhip. And hauing already diſpoſed her, by the knowledge of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he plainly declared to her at laſt, that he was the very Meſſias, who was come to ſaue the world; <pb n="26" facs="tcp:23762:20"/>and that which he tould her in words, he imprinted in her heart, giuing her both light to beleeue it, and courage, and deuotion to confeſſe it.</p>
            <p>What dearnes, what ſweetnes of diſcourſe, and conuerſation, can be imagined to exceed this? That the Creator of all thinges ſhould ſpeake, in ſo familiar ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with ſo baſe a creature, and that the eternal wiſedome ſhould vouch ſaffe by his very ſelfe, to inſtruct at ſo great leaſure and by ſuch a lowly manner of ſpeech, ſo ignorant and rude a woman, and ſhould giue ſo high myſteries to be vnderſtood ſo quickly and ſo clearly by her.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Benignity,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord vſed towards this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Apoſtles were in wonder at it, as Saint
<hi>Chryſostome</hi> obſerueth ſaying; The Apoſtles <pb n="27" facs="tcp:23762:20"/>were in admiration to ſee that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue meekenes, and humility of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, in that he was content, ſo publickly and in ſight of all men, to ſpeake ſo of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſo at leaſure, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignely with a poore woman, &amp; that a poore Samaritan.</p>
            <p>There came to <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.
<hi>Marc.</hi> 5. a ſicke woman who was ſubiect to a bloody fluxe, and ſhe came with much want of vertue; for out of ſhame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate feare, ſhe durſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her infirmity; and ſhee thought to keepe her ſelfe from being known by <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, by meanes of the preſſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, coming ſecretly neer him, without the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others; and meaning, after this ſorte, to ſteale health fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as his knowing of it, who was to giue it. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <pb n="28" facs="tcp:23762:21"/>ſhee came ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and weake, our moſt pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord, did paſſe by all theſe defects of hers, without ſo much as reprehending them, or reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her for them; and he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that which ſhe deſired, and hoped for, yea and much more then that. For inſtantly he cured her of that corporall infirmity, and he cured her ſoule, by taking away that vaine feare, to which ſhe had bene ſubiect, and by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe both her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the health which ſhe had receiued; and by augmenting in her, the gifts of faith and loue. And hauing vſed ſo great <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> towards her by this worke, he was alſo benigne to her in words. For putting her into quiet, and giuing her comfort, he ſaid, <hi>Thy faith hath made the whole.</hi> Which was as much as to ſay; In regard <pb n="29" facs="tcp:23762:21"/>of that ſaith, wherewith thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt touch mee, although it was imperfect, I haue deliuered thee from thy diſeaſe: goe thy waies in peace, and ſtill be free from the ſame diſeaſe. So ſaith <hi>Chriſostome.</hi> This woman had not a perfect opinion of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, for if ſhe had, ſhe would neuer haue imagined, that ſhe could hide her ſelf from him; &amp; our Lord tooke publicke notice of her, for the good both of her ſelfe, and many others. For by diſcouering her, he tooke away her feare, and he preuented that remorce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which was to accuſe her, as hauing ſtolne the gift of her health; and he rectified her from that falſe imagination; and he made her know, that nothing could be hid from our Lord, and then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding her faith, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her for an example to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <pb n="30" facs="tcp:23762:22"/>by others.</p>
            <p>Wee alſo are to imitate <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord in that
<hi>Benignity</hi> which he vſed towards ſuch as came to him full of imperfection, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ignorance; and wee muſt receiue after a ſweet manner our neighbours, when they come to vs full of neceſſity &amp; ignorance; enduring with a ſerene counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their importunity, &amp; rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and giuing eare and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their queſtions; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignely inſtructing them in thoſe thinges which are fit for them to be knowne by them, according to the capacity of euery one, and remouing the ignorance, wherin they are, &amp; comforting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the knowledge of truth, and the hope of ſaluation, and appeaſing their conſcience, deliuering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from vaine ſcruples and feares.</p>
            <p>To this doth the Apoſtle Saint <pb n="31" facs="tcp:23762:22"/>
               <hi>Paule Gal.</hi> 6. aduiſe in theſe words. My brethren, if any of you be ſurpriſed by any ſinne; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to them who ſinne out of Paſſion, or weaknes, orignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and not out of meer malice; and who are as it were preuented, and ſurpriſed by that ſinne, into which they fal, becauſe they haue not well conſidered the ill they doe, in reſpect whereof they are the more worthy of mercy, and more eaſy to be reformed; If any ſuch, I ſay, haue fallen, you who are ſpiritual men, and liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſpirit, (that is, according to the true and ſpirituall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Lawe of God) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and informe well ſuch a kinde of ſinner as this; and doe it not with ſharpenes, &amp; rigour, but with ſweetnes and gentlenes both of words, and deedes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in true
<hi>Benignity</hi> conſiſts. And for <pb n="32" facs="tcp:23762:23"/>this purpoſe, let euery one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider himſelfe, and reflect well vpon his owne weaknes, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and how ſubiect he is to fall, as the other did, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worſe. And from hence he will grow to inſtruct, and correct others, with the ſweetnes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and <hi>Benignity,</hi> and not with too much rigour, and ſeuerity; leaſt himſelfe alſo growe both to be tempted, and conquered. This in ſubſtance is deliuered by the Apoſtle; and with great reaſon he wiſheth him who treateth ſuch, as haue fallen into ſinne, without mercy and <hi>Benignity,</hi> that he looke well to himſelfe, leaſt he be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ouercome. For in very truth it is the puniſhment, which he deſerues, and which ordinarily almighty God inflicts, vpon ſuch as raſhly iudge and condemne their neighbour for committing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23762:23"/>any fault, and as deſpiſe him for it, to let them fall into the ſame ſinne. As on the other ſide, our moſt piteous Lord, is wont to vſe ſupreme <hi>Benign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> &amp; mercy towards their weak and imperfect brethren. This did that great and admirable woman <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> with great ponderation and feeling affirme, when ſhee ſaid; There is no thing in the whole world which doth more moue <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord to vſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> and mercy towards men, then to ſee that themſelues are benigne and mercifull towards others; and ſuch <hi>Benignity</hi> and mercy, cannot but leade them on to a happy death, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them vp to eternall life.</p>

            <head>THE III. CHAPTER. <hi>Of the Benignity which Chriſt our Lord vſed towards the Apoſtles, enduring and curing their defects.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis very manner of <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord vſe towardes his bleſſed Apoſtles, whilſt he conuerſed with them, in mortall fleſh. For during all that time (which was the ſpace of three yeares) they were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and liued in great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and by reaſon of their much rudnes, made litle profit of the great light of doctrine which was propounded to them; and of that ſo admirable example of the life of
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord; which they had before their eyes. Let vs produce ſome examples to proue <pb n="35" facs="tcp:23762:24"/>this truth.</p>
            <p>Our Lord had already wrought that illuſtrious miracle, in the ſight of his diſciples, <hi>Matt</hi> 15 of feeding fiue thouſand men with fiue loaues of bread; and ſhortly after, another neceſſity offering it ſelf, wherin our Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to feed foure thouſand men with ſeauen loaues, and hauing already tould his diſciples, that he would not permit thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of men &amp; woemen, to returne home to their houſes, till he had fed them; they conceiued it to be a matter of ſo much difficulty, that (as if it had indeed been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for our Lord to doe) they ſaid, <hi>where can wee be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in this deſert, ſuch a quantity of bread, as would be neceſſary for the feeding of ſuch a multitude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a great imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was this in them? and what a ſtrange
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23762:25"/>rudenes, and blindenes of heart, that hauing ſeen with their owne eyes, that our Lord had wrought ſo many like, and greater mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles then that, they did not yet beleeue, and confide ſo much in him, as that with ſo few loaues, he was able to feed ſo much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and eſpecially conſidering, that he had declared himſelfe to haue a will to doe it; and that he had wrought the like in the ſelfe ſame caſe ſome few dayes before. And yet theſe diſciples, making him anſwere with ſo little faith, and indeed with ſo little good manners; our moſt bleſſed Lord did yet treate them with ſo great tendernes, and ſweetnes, that he blamed, or reproued them not; nor ſhewed himſelfe a whit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted, or offended, for the little account, and eſtimation which they ſhewed themſelues to haue <pb n="37" facs="tcp:23762:25"/>of his power. But paſſing by all this, he asked them how many loaues they had, and they ſaying that they had ſeauen, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the troupes to ſit downe, and he gaue them all to eate of thoſe ſeauen loaues, and he made the Apoſtles gather vp ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baskets full of the ouerplus; and in this ſorte, he did by that action of his let them ſee their rudenes, and he remoued their ignorance, &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them faſter in their faith. And this was ſo great a fault in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that the confeſſing and publiſhing of it themſelues, after the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, was an act of great humility in them; and the ſuffering and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it by our Lord, with ſo great pitty and mercy, was admirable <hi>Benignity</hi> in him. So ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſostome.</hi> It is worthy of great admiration, to ſee the Apoſtles <pb n="38" facs="tcp:23762:26"/>ſo great friends to the truth, as that themſelues, who wrote the Euangelicall hiſtory, would not couer thoſe ſo great faults of their owne. For it was no little one, that they could ſo ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that miracle, which our Lord had wrought ſo lately before, in the multiplication of the fiue loaues of bread. And <hi>Theophylact</hi> addeth thus; It was not reaſon that they ſhould ſo ſoon haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that miracle, whereby our Lord had giuen food in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, to more perſons, with fewer loaues of bread. But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, were men very groſſe, and of meane vnderſtanding; which our Lord permitted to be ſo, to the end that when afterward wee ſhould finde them ſo full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and wiſedome, we might know that it was the gift of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace, which cauſed it. But
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23762:26"/>their ignorance and vntowardnes being ſo great, as wee ſee it was, our Lord did not yet rebuke, or reproach them for this fault, but cured it with great <hi>Benignity;</hi> and inſtructed vs thereby, not to put our ſelues in choler with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, nor to be ſharpe or wayward towards them, but that we muſt haue compaſſion of their ignorance, and inſtruct them and correct them with charity.</p>
            <p>Our Lord did alſo diſcouer his <hi>Benignity</hi> to the Apoſtles, in that hauing already wrought that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the ſeauen loaues; &amp; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that they were <hi>to take heed of the leuen of the Phariſees and Saduces, Matt.</hi> 16. <hi>Marc.</hi> 8. (which ſignified their euill doctrine and example) they would needes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand as if he had ſaid it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not prouided of bread inough for the deſert; and <pb n="40" facs="tcp:23762:27"/>ſo they were affraid they might want food. And our Lord repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this fault in them, which they had added to the former, ſaid in this manner; do you not vnderſtand, and remember the fiue loues of bread, and the fiue thouſand men, which I ſuſteined with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; nor yet the ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loues, wherewith I fed foure thouſand men? And thus reprouing them, as much as was neceſſary, he did it yet in words as gentle, as you haue heard; and with ſo great ſweetnes, as that, together with reprehending them, he excuſed them; imputing their fault to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and forgetfulnes. O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Benignity,</hi> worthy of ſuch a Lord as he, who together with the chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, giueth comfort; and whileſt he ſpeaketh of the fault, he giueth hope of pardon and remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So doth Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:23762:27"/>obſerue. Conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion which he giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all tempered with meekenes; for whileſt he reproues them, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth them; yea &amp; he anſwereth for the very men whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth.</p>
            <p>But let vs looke vpon ſome other examples of this
<hi>Benignity,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord did vſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his diſciples. When thus he had anſwered that rich young man, <hi>Matt.</hi>
19. who ſaid. He had kept the comaundments, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, goe and ſell all that thou hast, and giue it to the poore, and come and follow mee, and thou shalt haue treaſure in heauen,</hi> and when the young man was going ſad away, becauſe he was very rich, and had not the heart to embrace the counſaile of our Lord, and to make himſelf poore for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid <pb n="42" facs="tcp:23762:28"/>to our Lord,
<hi>Behould, ô Lord, how as for vs, wee haue left all thinges, and wee haue followed thee, what therfore shall be done to vs?</hi> What reward wilt thou beſtow on vs? Our Lord made them this anſwere; <hi>Verily I ſay to you, that you who haue followed mee, shall ſit vpon twelue ſeates, and thrones, to iudge the twelue Tribes of Iſraell, with the Sonne of man, when he shall ſit in the ſeate of his Maiesty,</hi> at the generall reſurrection to a life of glory. At that day, you ſhal haue great authority, and glory, by raigning with the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of man, and iudging the world together with him.</p>
            <p>It was very little, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles had left for <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord; for they were but a poore company of fiſhermen; and that which they had left (as Saint
<hi>Chryſostom</hi> ſaith) was ſome fiſhing rod, ſome net,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23762:28"/>and ſome little barke. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though together with theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they alſo left whatſoeuer they might growe to haue, yet that alſo muſt needes be very little; for in the trade they had, they were neuer able to get much. And all this being ſo little, and that Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> with ſo much liberty, and audacity ſhould ſay to him,
<hi>Behould, ô Lord, wee haue left all, wee had, for thee,</hi> as if they had left moſt abundant riches and great hopes; our Lord might with much truth and reaſon, haue ſaid to Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: What greate poſſeſsions haſt thou left for mee; and what great acts of prowes haſt thou performed in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice?</hi> And yet he ſaid no ſuch thing; nor did he anſwere them with any ſhew of any diſdaine or eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſguſt, or with little eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which had been left for his ſake; but he ſpake to him <pb n="44" facs="tcp:23762:29"/>in great earneſt and with wordes, of much weight and with ſhew of great eſtimation of that which they had leſt, and of that which they had performed in following him; and he declared that moſt high reward of glory &amp; that moſt eminent dignity which he would giue them, in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>By this anſwere, <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord did ſhew extreme
<hi>Benignity,</hi> partly by making ſo great account of ſuch a trifle as his diſciples had left for his ſake; and promiſing ſuch a ſoueraigne reward for ſuch a ſleight ſeruice as they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in following him; and partly by ſhewing how greatly he loued them, who then had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured ſo little for him; and by eſteeming them ſo much, who were ſo meane, and poore, as to promiſe to exalt them to ſo great <pb n="45" facs="tcp:23762:29"/>dignity, and to giue them a ſeate of ſo great Maieſty; and by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them in words ſo ſerious, ſo ſweet, ſo full of comfort; and which gaue them ſuch a height of hope. So ſaith <hi>Origen.</hi> Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> asked what reward he would giue him for what he had left, as if he had performed things of mighty difficulty. But although the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he &amp; his brother left were little, in the account of the world; yet in the ſight of God who regarded the loue, and great good will wherewith they were left, they were much eſteemed. This is the moſt benigne &amp; ſweet condition of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and our God; who be houldeth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which are done him, and the good will men haue to ſerue him, &amp; their holy deſire to pleaſe him, and that grace which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally beſtoweth for the doing <pb n="46" facs="tcp:23762:30"/>of them; and therfore doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence little works, with moſt high and euerlaſting rewardes.</p>
            <p>Our Lord, 10.11. whileſt he was in the deſert, hauing heard the meſſage of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſicknes, and two daies paſſing on, after he had heard it; and now vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, he ſaid reſolutely; <hi>Let vs goe yet once againe into Iudea;</hi> for Bethania was ſeated in that Prouince. But his diſciples anſwered him after this manner, <hi>Maſter, it is but the other day, ſince the Iewes were ready to ſtone thee in Iudea, and doeſt thou thinke of going backe, where there is ſo much danger?</hi> And our Lord ſaying ſtill, <hi>let vs goe yet againe into Iudea,</hi> and they ſeeing his reſolution and being full of apprehenſion and feare of death, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid to the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Well then, let vs goe, and dy with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:23762:30"/>Now the Apoſtles hauing known by ſo many experiments, that our Lord knew the ſecrets of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hearts, and that his enemies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a minde to take and ſtone him, were not able to touch him,
<hi>becauſe he had all power in his hands;</hi> and hauing heard him ſay many times, <hi>that in all thinges he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the will, and good pleaſure of his eternall Father;</hi> they ought to haue beleeued, that if our Lord went into Iudea, it was moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient thnt he ſhould doe ſo; and that he knew very well whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer was to happen to him there; &amp; that if he ſhould haue a minde to free himſelfe from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they could faſten no hurte vpon him; and that themſelues going in his company, might hould themſelues ſecure inough; and that without his will, they could receiue no harme; and that <pb n="48" facs="tcp:23762:31"/>they ought to make themſelues wholly ſubiect to that will of his. But they forgetting all this and diſtruſting his power and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, would haue hindred his going into Iudea, and would needes haue diſſuaded him from the reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he had taken in that behalfe; as if he had been either ignorant of the danger which there he might incurre, or impuiſſant in defending himſelfe from the ſame; and they were full of apprehenſion and feare, as if our Lord had not been able to protect them.</p>
            <p>And theſe defects of theirs being ſo great, our moſt merciful Lord was not yet offended with them; nor did he ſhew any diſguſt, nor did he reproue them with ſharpe wordes, for the meane conceit which they had of him; but he informed them in ſweet termes, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:23762:31"/>that there was no danger in his iourney, and that they might hould themſelues ſafe in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by ſaying thus to them; <hi>Are there not perhaps twelue houres in the day? He who goes by day, ſtumbles not, becauſe the day light lets him ſee the way; but he who walkes by night, may ſtumble and fall, becauſe he ſeeth not the light.</hi> Whereby he would let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know, that iuſt as, whileſt the naturall day laſteth, which hath twelue houres of light, it is not in the skill or power of any creature to take away or diminiſh any one of theſe houres, or any part thereof; and that during this time, a man may walke ſecurely without ſtumbling or falling; iuſt ſo, as long as that time of his life was to laſt in this world, which had been determined by the will of his eternall Father, in which time he was to illuminate the <pb n="50" facs="tcp:23762:32"/>world with his doctrine, and by his miracles, there was no cauſe for them to feare; for that all the power of the world was not able to take one moment of that time from him; and that ſo both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and al they of his company, were very ſafe. With this <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> did he tolerate their boldnes, and cure their rudenes, and their want of that faith, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which they ought to haue had in our Lord.</p>

And as for the other ten, he refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them alſo by calling them to him, &amp; aduertiſing them, that to deſire commaund, and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ouer others, was the vice of Gentiles, who lodged not their heart vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly but on earthly thinges; and that they were not to doe ſo, but to imitate their Lord and Maſter, who came into this world, not to be ſerued by men but to ſerue them, yea and to giue his life for them.</p>
            <p>With this <hi>Benignity, Christ</hi> our <pb n="54" facs="tcp:23762:34"/>Lord did tolerate, and cure thoſe ſo great defects of his diſciples. So ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> As thoſe two Apoſtles did obey the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate appetite of fleſh &amp; blood and did beg of our Lord, the two chief ſeates in his kingdome; ſo alſo the other ten, obeying the like euill inclination of fleſh and blood, were offended and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the demaund, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the former two. For it was ill done by the two, to deſire to be preferred before the reſt; and the reſt, conceiued it to be an affront to them, that the two ſhould be preferred before them. And Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> addeth; That our Lord, who was al meeke and and humble, did not ſharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that inordinate appetite of honour, wherewith thoſe two came to him; nor yet the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and enuy, which the ten
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23762:34"/>conceiued againſt the two; but he treated them, and inſtructed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured them all with ſupreme <hi>Benignity,</hi> and meeknes.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles being in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with our Lord, the night of his Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>he admonished them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine watchfull in prayer, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they might fall into that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; tribulation, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming towards them.</hi> But they, the while, laid themſelues to ſleepe; and our Lord hauing been at Prayer, and going to viſit them, and finding that they were fallen a ſleepe, did wiſh them a ſecond time,
<hi>to watch and pray;</hi> and he ſaid; <hi>Why ſleepe you? riſe vp to watch, and pray, least els you be ouercome by temptation.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen them this leſſon, he returned againe to Prayer, and after went to ſee them a ſecond time: and finding them aſleepe yet againe, he ſaid nothing to <pb n="56" facs="tcp:23762:35"/>them. A third time he went to Prayer; and a third time he went to ſee them; and finding them ſtill ſleeping, as being oppreſſed by the great ſorrow they had, he ſaid to them, <hi>ſleepe on, and take your rest.</hi> And ſo he left them for a while, till the time was come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enemies who were to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, were approaching. Then he turned towards them &amp; ſaid; <hi>It is enough: riſe vp, let vs goe; for the hower is already come, wherein the Sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to be deliuered ouer, into the hands of ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a great defect in the diſciples, becauſe they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, of the much danger wherein they were to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that night; and they had promiſed, that they would giue their life for our Lord; and they had been warned by him, two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times in words of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration, <pb n="57" facs="tcp:23762:35"/>and waight, that they ſhould <hi>watch and pray,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were to be tempted in a grieuous manner; and their prayer was to be the meanes, for their not being ouercome by that temptation. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all this, they neither wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, nor prayed; and they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues to be ouercome by ſleepe, which was the cauſe, why afterward being ouercome by the temptation, they fled all away for feare, at the time when our Lord was apprehended, and they denyed their Maſter, who was the head and crowne of them all. But yet our Lord did ſuffer, and paſſe by, &amp; ſeeke to reforme this ſo great defect with ſo great <hi>Benignity,</hi> that finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſleepe the firſt time, he corrected them with no other then theſe gentle wordes; <hi>Why ſleepe you?</hi> Whereby <pb n="58" facs="tcp:23762:36"/>he would giue them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how vaine that confidence was, which they had repoſed in their owne ſtrength, making a promiſe that they would giue their life for their Lord, whereas the while, they had not the ſtrength to watch and pray du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that little time. And when he went to viſit them the ſecond time, and perceiued them to be ouercome by ſleepe, through the great weaknes, and frailty of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect men, he diſſembled the ſeeing it, and hauing compaſſion of their infirmity, did not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, nor ſo much as ſpeake a word, nor wake them, but ſtill let them ſleepe. And the third time; returning to them, &amp; ſeing the difficulty they had to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their ſleepe, in regard of their much ſorrow, he did not onely paſſe it ouer, but expreſſely <pb n="59" facs="tcp:23762:36"/>gaue them leaue to repoſe and reſt, whileſt he was watching, and praying, and ſweating blood for them. With this ſo admirable <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> and ſo full of the deernes, and ſweetnes of loue, did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord treate his diſciples, and tolerate their defects, and endure the trouble they gaue him; and he remoued their ignorances and cured their faults.</p>

            <head>THE V. CHAPTER. <hi>How wee are to imitate this Benignity of Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis <hi>Benignity</hi> muſt wee vſe towards our neighbours, in imitation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord; and eſpecially it muſt be done by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours towards their Subiects, by Teachers towards their Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, by Maſters towards their <pb n="60" facs="tcp:23762:37"/>Seruants and ſlaues, and by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents towards their children. Firſt they muſt exerciſe this
<hi>Benignity</hi> by enduring their imperfections, negligences and faults; not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues to be ouercome by wrath, to wiſh them any euill, or to curſe them, or giue them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious words, or any other word of reuenge. And to this exteriour patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they muſt add the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of
<hi>Benignity,</hi> in ſuch ſorte, as that it may be a benigne kinde of ſufferance, which ſpringeth from the interiour ſweetnes of
<hi>Charity.</hi> To this did Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh vs, who vpon thoſe words of Saint <hi>Paul, Charity is patient, &amp; it is benigne,</hi> diſcourſeth thus; There are ſome who haue patience, but they doe not vſe it as they ought; for although in the exteriour, they are ſilent, and diſſemble the cauſe of their diſguſt, yet they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23762:37"/>doe it with a kinde of bitternes of heart yea and they ſhew ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour vntowardnes, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualue of their neighbour; and ſo they grow to offend, and prouoke to further wrath, euen thoſe very perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whom they were reſolued to tolerate. This kinde of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is not agreeable to charity which is benigne, and vſeth to ſuffer with gentlenes and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both exteriour &amp; interiour; and whileſt it is ſuffering, doth not prouoke a mans neighbour to encreaſe of anger, but rather doth mitigate, and appeaſe it. For we muſt not be content to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the faultes of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, after a ſuperficial manner; but whileſt wee be ſuffering, wee muſt alſo admoniſh and comfort them; and thus ſhall we cure that wound of wrath, which they may haue in their hearts. Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> 
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:23762:38"/>declareth; that this is to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with <hi>Benignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Superiors alſo who haue charge of others, muſt exerciſe this
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity;</hi> prouiding all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both for their bodies and ſoules: for their bodies, giuing them food, cloathing, phyſicke in their ſicknes, eaſe in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and comfort in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; to the end that they may beare them with contentment: and for their ſoules alſo by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them doctrine, counſelle: ſpirituall conſolation, and good example, which may edify them. This doe Prelates owe to their Subiects; Lords to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and ſlaues; and fathers to their children.
<hi>Benignity</hi> I ſay, doth require, that Superiours make prouiſion of all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both for the body and ſoule, of all ſuch as are vnder <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23762:38"/>their charge, not ſparingly &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably, not with diſguſt and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, and vexation of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; but ſufficiently, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, according to the neceſſity of the inferiour, &amp; to the ability and meanes of the Superiour; and that they doe it with facility, and ſuauity, and with comfort to the inferiour. For to this is the office and charge of a Superiour ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; not for the honour, &amp; eaſe, and temporall comfort of the Superiour; but for the remedy &amp; benefit of the inferiour, whom he hath in charge. So ſaith Saint
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi> Wee who are Superiours, and Paſtors of others, haue two capacities; the one, in that we are Chriſtians; the other, in that we are Superiours, and rulers. Our being Chriſtians, makes for our ſelues; and vnder that capacity, we are to looke to our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, <pb n="64" facs="tcp:23762:39"/>fit, and good: but our being Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, is for the vſe of others; and for the complying with this duty, wee muſt procure their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit whom wee haue in charge. This is deliuered by Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi> And although it be true, that the Superiour, as he is a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, is not to looke ſo carefully to his owne temporall profit, as to that of his ſubiect, yet doing that which he ought in his office, and complying with them whom he hath vnder his charge, he doth alſo negotiate his owne profit, &amp; diſpatcheth his owne buſineſſe beſt, ſince he purchaſeth ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and eternall benedictions thereby.</p>
            <p>All Superiours muſt alſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this <hi>Benignity,</hi> by impoſing the burdens of their imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and commaundements, in ſuch ſorte, as that the inferiours may <pb n="65" facs="tcp:23762:39"/>be able to carry them on, with comfort. Let them meaſure out the labours, the buſineſſe, and the offices wherewith they will charge their ſubiects, by the ſtrength, and talents of euery one of them; to the end that they may not carry them with deepe ſighes, nor be forced to faint vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but that they may be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them with a cheerfull and contented heart. And let them moderate their directions and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundments, whereby they rule and gouerne, according to the capacity and talent of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; that ſo they diſpoſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to obey, and to doe their duties, may performe them with facility, and profit of their ſoules. So faith Saint <hi>Chryſostome;</hi> If thou wilt proceed like a man who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is holy, be auſtere and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous towards thy ſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne <pb n="66" facs="tcp:23762:40"/>and pitteous towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and let men ſee, and heare it ſaid of thee, that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt others to doe thinges which are light, and eaſy, to be performed; and that thy ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoeſt heauy, and performeſt hard thinges.</p>
            <p>As for that which concerneth the chaſtiſement and correction of inferiours, the vertue of <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> doth not teach, that they ſhould not be corrected: for this vertue is not contrary either to that of
<hi>Iuſtice,</hi> or to that of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> both which oblige Princes that they ſhould correct, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe their vaſſailes; Lords and Maſters their ſeruants, &amp; ſlaues; parents their children. For, the Apoſtle faith of that Superiour, who gouerneth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wealth. It is not in vaine that he hath power and authority to puniſh; <pb n="67" facs="tcp:23762:40"/>as we ſee by the ſword he carrieth; but it is giuen him vpon great cauſe and reaſon, and for a great good vſe; for he is the Miniſter of God, for the puniſhment of ſuch as doe ill, and for the execution of iuſtice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their perſons. That which <hi>Benignity</hi> doth teach and exact is this; that ſince correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and puniſhment is neceſſary, and moſt important for the generall good of the commonwealth, and for the particular members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which is, to the end that they who are faulty, may amend; and the reſt may feare puniſhment, and take warning by others, it muſt be executed with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration &amp; ſweetnes, which may carry moſt proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this end, as Chriſt our Lord hath taught vs by his example.</p>
            <p>This moderation &amp; ſweetnes, conſiſteth in that; when the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours <pb n="68" facs="tcp:23762:41"/>commit ſmall faultes, the Superiours doe not exaggerate, and enforce them too much, nor correct them with too grieuous puniſhments; but that they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their wordes and deedes, according to the fault. So faith Saint <hi>Dorotheus;</hi> Be not to great, nor too ſeuere a puniſher of faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and defects, which are not great. And ſo alſo, when faultes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted through ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or through great weakenes, or vpon ſome vehement temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not with malice; obſerue that moderation, in making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and inflicting the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as that you affront not the offender, with ill wordes; but that the paine he is to ſuffer, may leſſen, according to the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and weaknes, wherewith the fault was made.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <pb n="69" facs="tcp:23762:41"/>who ſinned through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or paſſion, is ſuch as that of himſelfe he growes to know his fault, and hath much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction for it; and doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially put himſelfe vpon amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that noe hurt or ill example of others groweth by it; the vertue of <hi>Benignity</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that the puniſhment be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or moderated at leaſt, very much. So ſaith Saint
<hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory;</hi> Some faultes are to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed very gently; for when men ſinne not by malice, but by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or weakenes, it is neceſſary that the correction and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, be tempered with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. And in another place; as the fault of them, who ſinne by ignorance, may be tolerated in ſome ſorte, ſo they who commit it wittingly, and wilfully, muſt be ſeuerely puniſhed. And that it <pb n="70" facs="tcp:23762:42"/>is more conuenient to pardon a fault ſometimes, then to inflict puniſhment, the Venerable
<hi>Bede</hi> doth affirme ſaying; Not allwaies are they to be puniſhed, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; for ſometimes clemency doth more good, both to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour for the exerciſe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to the inferiour for his amendment. When faultes are great, &amp; vnexcuſable by any ignorance, and that it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to inflict due puniſhment; that which <hi>Benignity</hi> requires, is, that the Superiour who corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and puniſheth, be not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to it by anger and paſſion; but that in his heart, he haue pitty of the delinquent, and that he commit no exceſſe in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; but that he temper, and moderate it in ſuch ſorte, as that it may not ſeeme cruelty, or too much rigour: for els he who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth, <pb n="71" facs="tcp:23762:42"/>and puniſheth, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more hurt, by his owne paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the exceſſe which he vſeth, then he who is puniſhed will receiue good. So doth Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> aduiſe, ſpeaking to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. Let ſuch as are good, finde by experience that thou art ſweet towards them; and let ſuch as are euill, finde by experience, that thou haſt zeale in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and puniſhing their faults. In which puniſhment, thou art to obſerue this order, that thou loue the perſon, and that thou abhorre and perſecute the vice; procuring that the vice may be deſtroyed, &amp; that the perſon may be amended, and preſerued; and according to this, let the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be moderated in ſuch ſorte, that it reach not ſoe farre, as to proue cruelty; &amp; ſo thou happen to hurt, and to looſe him, whom
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23762:43"/>thou deſireſt to amend, &amp; keepe.</p>
            <p>And to the end that the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; puniſhment may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with that moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which <hi>Benignity</hi> requires, let the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riout procure, that he do it not, whileſt he findes himſelfe angry, and altered, or enflamed with choler; but let him ſtay, till his heart be calme and quiet. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he puniſh, or reproue, let him lift vp his heart to God, and deſire fauour and grace from heauen; to the end that he may do it with ſuch moderation as is fit; and to ſuch end as he ought; which is, that the delinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may amend, and ſo others may take warning by his example, &amp; that the diuine Maieſty may be ſerued and glorified by all. This doth S. <hi>Dorotheus</hi> declare to vs, by theſe wordes. Our Predeceſſors &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, the holy men, did teach <pb n="73" facs="tcp:23762:43"/>vs, that if any Superiour being in anger, did reprehend his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect chollerickely; in ſuch ſorte, as reprehending the other, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his owne paſſion &amp; anger, it did amount to be a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge; and he diſcouered the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes of his owne heart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he diſedified them, whom he was to reforme. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is fit, that firſt he bridle his owne choler, and be wholly in the hands of reaſon, before he puniſh other folkes.</p>
            <p>All this moderation, which is neceſſary to the end that corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and puniſhment be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with <hi>Benignity,</hi> the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, ſpeaking thus to his diſciple Saint <hi>Timothy; Argue,</hi> (that is to ſay conuince ſuch as erre, with reaſons and authorities) <hi>and entreate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, admoniſh the good by <pb n="74" facs="tcp:23762:44"/>way of requeſt, and in ſweet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the end that they may profit; &amp; ſuch others as are weake, and puſillanimous, to the end that they may get vp into heart; and reprehend and correct the wicked, with feruour &amp; zeale; but yet this you muſt doe, with much patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. In a word, you muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſuch as are faulty, without ſhewing your ſelfe angry, or in paſſion; but let them ſee, that you haue a calme, and quiet heart.</p>

<hi>Marke</hi> 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. and their diſeaſes of many kindes, (for they came from ſeuerall parts of that Prouince, to hunt after their health by his meanes) he touched <pb n="77" facs="tcp:23762:45"/>euery one of them with his owne ſacred hands, and gaue them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health; the whole Citty, the while, ſtanding al amazed at that wonder, to ſee how he touched them one by one, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly withall, they were cured.</p>
            <p>Hauing once preached a ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Mount, he deſcended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the plaine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>Mark,</hi> 1. and there came many troupes of people to him. Amongſt the reſt, there approached a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all loaden with leaprouſy; and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of al that multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he placed himſelfe vpon his knees, before our Lord, (but a litle ſeparated from him,) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to cure him of that leaprouſy, ſaying. <hi>O Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make mee whole.</hi> Now our Lord could haue cured him with the leaſt word; yet, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf with that, but to the <pb n="78" facs="tcp:23762:46"/>that he might ſhew the more
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> he extended his hand ſo farre as to reach him, and touch his leprous body, ſaying, <hi>I will, be thou cleane;</hi> and inſtantly he was cured.</p>
            <p>After the myſtery of the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, Matth.</hi> 17
<hi>Marke</hi> 9. there came troupes of people who were expecting him, and they brought a lunaticke before him, who was extremely tormented by a diuell. Our Lord commaunded the diuel to depart, who yet at his going out, did treate the young man ſo ill, as that he fell to the ground like a dead body. And whereas our Lord could eaſily haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to riſe vp, or els appoint one of his diſciples to raiſe him, he did not ſo; but himſelfe went towards the young man, and tooke him by the hand, and raiſed him vp; and then the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23762:46"/>young man being touched, and aſſiſted by our Lord, who ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in his handes, did riſe.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was in <hi>Bethſaida, Marc.</hi> 8. they brought a blind ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him that he might cure him, which he would not doe in the Citty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that people, but abroad in the field. And when he might haue commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them, who led him, to conduct him forth of the Citty, he was not pleaſed to ſerue himſelfe of any other in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but himſelfe would needes take the poore blinde man by the hand, and drew him a ſide into a part of the field out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and himſelfe lead him, and became his guide, and to cure him laid his hand vpon his eyes, and to diſcouer his
<hi>Benignity</hi> to vs, he vouchſaffed himſelfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be the leader of a poore blinde man, which is a worke of <pb n="80" facs="tcp:23762:47"/>ſo much humility and meannes. Not onely did he vſe this kinde of <hi>Benignity</hi> with men, but alſo poore ſicke woemen. The mother in lawe of Saint
<hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>Marc.</hi> 1. was ſicke of a violent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. He went into her houſe to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her, he drew neer her, he tooke her by the hand, and he raiſed her vp, commaunding the feauer to forſake her: ſo might he haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded her to riſe alone, but he would not do ſo, but would needs raiſe her vp himſelfe, to diſcouer his <hi>Benignity</hi> ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>Our Lord being preaching in a Sinagogue one Saboth day,
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. there came before him, a ſicke &amp; miſerable creature, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed crookedly downe euen to the ground, and tormented by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; and our moſt pitteous Lord called her gently to him, &amp; made her come neer him, and laid his <pb n="81" facs="tcp:23762:47"/>hands vpon her with great <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and gaue her perfect health.</p>
            <p>That which our Lord did with theſe ſicke and miſerable perſons, whereof wee haue ſpoken, he did at other times, with other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſicke people, who were ſubiect to horrible and loath ſome diſeaſes; for all the world came to him. And they who were ſo weake and waſted, that they could not come of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, were brought to him by others, &amp; ſo they drew neer him, and he touched them with his moſt bleſſed ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to cure them. Now that our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhould raiſe ſicke perſons out of their beds, or from the ground, to which they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, did proceed in him, from an vn ſpeakeable and moſt tender loue, who not onely was diſpoſed to doe men good, but alſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, honour, and regale ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <pb n="82" facs="tcp:23762:48"/>as he did good vnto: which was a fruite of the ſupreme ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his <hi>Benignity</hi> and loue.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THis example of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, hath generally been imitated much by holy men who thereby haue been moued, &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to ſerue ſicke perſons, and to cure them, and to raiſe them in their armes, and to clenſe them with their owne hands. And this hath been done, not onely by meane perſons, but by principall and great Lord; who not being content with giuing almes to poore ſicke people, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine them by their bounty, haue <pb n="83" facs="tcp:23762:48"/>themſelues, been glad to ſerue them, and ſtriue to cure them, ſometimes being ſicke of lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and other moſt loathſome &amp; corrupt ſoares; and haue with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

Let vs relate ſome examples of this truth.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity.</hi> And this he performed with ſo great cheerfullnes, and eſtimation of this office, as if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he had beheld the perſon of
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, in euery one of thoſe poor people. And finding on day a leaper, whoſe noſe, &amp; whoſe very eyes were eaten out, with the leprouſy, &amp; who was become euen abhominable to all that ſaw him; to this man he vſed extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tendernes, and gaue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regaloes, and ſerued him vpon his knees, putting the meat into his mouth, with his owne hands, and giuing him the wine &amp; water which he was to drinke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:23762:49"/>The Count <hi>Elzearus</hi> of Ariano had euery day in his houſe twelue Leapers, &amp; he waſhed their feet, and gaue them meate; and not content with what he did in his owne houſe, he went to the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, where they liued; and there putting himſelfe vpon his knees before them, he would waſh their feet, and kiſſe and clenſe and tie vp their ſoares.

               </gap>erua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but himſelf alſo was pleaſed to appeare to him in forme of a leper, that ſo he might receiue the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and regalo, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foarded to the reſt.</p>
            <p>Surius relateth in the life of Saint <hi>Ethbinus,</hi> the Abbot, whoſe feaſt is celebrated vpon the 19. of October, that another holy Prieſt going with him by the fieldes to his Monaſtery, they encountred in the way, a poore leper all full of ſoares, and deepely groaning vpon the ground, where he was laid. They came to him, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him, and hauing much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of his miſery, they asked him what he would haue? and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him all the ſeruice they could performe, although it were to giue him of their very <pb n="87" facs="tcp:23762:50"/>fleſh. The leper ſaid, the thinge which I deſire of you, is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my noſe is ſo ful of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and filth, you would aſſwage my grief, by making it cleane. They doe ſoe; and <hi>Ethbinus</hi> takes him in his armes, and raiſeth him vp from the ground, and the Prieſt comes, &amp; clenſeth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his ſore with his to u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. In that very inſtant, wherin they beganne this worke of ſo great <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Benignity,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered Angels from heauen cloſe by the leaper, and there appeared alſo a Croſſe, which was placed ouer his head; and the leaper roſe vp whole, all full of ſplendor, and beauty; and they ſaw cleerly that it was
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord. And when he was a little mounted vp, he ſaid. Yea were not aſhamed of mee, in my afflictions; neither will I be aſhamed to confeſſe you, <pb n="88" facs="tcp:23762:51"/>and to admit you as my ſeruants, in my kingdome; and when this was ſpoken he vaniſhed, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vp to heauen. The two Saints were amaſed, and full of mighty ioy, and could not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelues with praiſing God, for the great fauor he had ſhewed them, by appearing in the forme of an poore ſicke man; and for vouchſafing to receaue that poor ſeruice at their hand, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that with ſo great bounty as to giue them an aſſured hope, that they ſhould enioy him in his kingdome.</p>
            <p>There haue alſo been many Queenes, and great Ladies, in the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, who haue imitated his <hi>Benignity,</hi> towards ſicke perſons. <hi>Fortunatus</hi> the Biſhop, relates of
<hi>Radegundis</hi> the holy Queene of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (whoſe feaſt is celebrated in Auguſt) that <pb n="89" facs="tcp:23762:51"/>ſhee made an Infirmarie, into which ſhe gathered, and wherein ſhee cured a great multitude of ſicke perſons, and ſhee her ſelfe would ſerue them; and licke the corruption of their ſoares &amp; euen the wormes which grew therein, and ſhe would clenſe their heads, &amp; cut their haire. And eſpecially ſhe did this to leprous woemen, whom ſhe would embrace, and kiſſe, and anoint, and cure, and ſerue at table, with great ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of loue.</p>
            <p>The Queen <hi>Donna Iſabel,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Don Petro</hi> King of Arragon, and neece of <hi>S. Iſabell,</hi> daughter of the King of Hungary, who was married to <hi>Don Dionyſio</hi> King of Portugall, and who for her ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, is publikely reputed and ſerued in Portugall as a Saint by leaue of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herſelfe to giue all the goods <pb n="90" facs="tcp:23762:52"/>ſhe had to poore people, who were ſicke; but ſhee herſelfe would be ſeruing and curing them, in her owne perſon. And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe would cauſe both men and woemen who were ſicke of loathſome infirmities, as ſoares, and leproſies and cankers, to be ſought forth, &amp; ſecretly brought into her Palace, and there ſhee cleanſed, and cured and ſerued, and regaled them with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of pietie, that ſhe could make; &amp; ſhe would kiſſe the feet, &amp; the ſoares of the leprous woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. One day waſhing the feet of a woman who was leprous, the woman hid one of them, becauſe it had been much eaten with the canker and there diſtilled forth corrupt matter, which gaue a moſt loathſom ſauour. The Quee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made one of her woemen draw forth the leprous foote, &amp; put it <pb n="91" facs="tcp:23762:52"/>in a baſen, that ſhe might waſh it. When this was done, there came ſuch a peſtiferous ſauour from that foote, that the Queenes woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not being able to endure it, went all out of the roome. The Queene remaining alone with the leaper, did gently touch the foote with her hand, for feare of hurting it, and ſhe clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed it; and ſtooping kiſt it with that horrible ſore which it had. And
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord being pleaſed to diſcouer how much guſt be taketh in ſuch workes of piety, did entirely cure the leaper at the inſtant, when the Queene kiſt her foote.</p>
            <p>Now wee alſo are to imitate <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and his Saints, in this ſweet and benigne kind of charity, towards poore ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and wee muſt viſit them in their houſes, and hoſpitalls, and infirmaries, and wee muſt ſerue <pb n="92" facs="tcp:23762:53"/>and cleanſe, and cure and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort them, and prouide them, the beſt wee may, of all things neceſſary. And howſoeuer wee may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in great height of nobility, and dignity, yet muſt we not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to affoard ſuch ſeruices &amp; regaloes to poore ſicke people; ſince this was done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, who is the King of glory; and many Chriſtian Kings and Queenes, haue done the ſame for loue of him. And it is a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory for vs to be able to do a worke ſo acceptable, and pleaſing to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and ſo profitable to our owne ſoules; and of ſo great edification and good example to our neighbours and which hath the aſſurance of ſo immenſe a reward in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT doth alſo belong to this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Benignity,</hi> to giue that to ones neighbour, which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, with facility and ſweetnes; yea and more then that which he deſireth; and not to reflect vpon the indignity of him who asketh, nor vpon the authority &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that Lord, who may need the like; but to conſider what is agreable to charity, which when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is great, it communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe to all, and doth good to all, and taketh order that in many things, the high and lowe,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23762:54"/>the great and little men of the world, be made equall to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord left vs many examples of this truth. Saint
<hi>Luke chap. 18.</hi> relateth how once coming to the Citty of Iericho, a blinde man neer the way was asking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; and when he heard the noiſe of the people in company of our Lord, and vnderſtood that it was <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth,</hi> who paſſed by, he began to cry out and ſay, <hi>Ieſus thou ſonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.</hi> And although the people bad him hould his peace, yet ſtill he continued in crying out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching our Lord that he would free him from the miſery wherin he was. Our Lord heard his cry, and deteined himſelfe in the high way, and made all that people which was in his company ſtay with him, and commaunded that <pb n="95" facs="tcp:23762:54"/>they ſhould bring the blind beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him, and he ſtayed expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting till he came; &amp; being come, he asked him this queſtion;
<hi>What wouldest thou haue mee doe for thee? What doeſt thou deſire at my hands?</hi> The blinde man anſwered; the thing which I deſire and beg of thee, is that thou wilt giue mee my ſight: and inſtantly our Lord, without the leaſt delay, gaue him that which he deſired, and ſaid; <hi>Receiue thy ſight.</hi> And he receiued the ſight of his corporall eyes, &amp; the ſight alſo of his ſoule; for being full of faith, and deuotion he followed <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, both with body and ſoule; and did not ceaſe from glorifying Almighty God. This paſſed at the entry which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord made into Iericho, for Saint <hi>Luke</hi> relates that he entred into Iericho, after he had wrought this miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:23762:55"/>Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> alſo <hi>chap.</hi> 20. ſhewes, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord going forth of the ſame Citty of Iericho, and being accompanied with much people, there ſtood two blinde men, cloſe vpon the way, demaunding almes; &amp; when they knew that
<hi>Ieſus</hi> paſſed by, they began to cry out and ſay, <hi>Ieſus the ſonne of Dauid, take pitty on vs. Christ</hi> our Lord did inſtantly make a ſtand in the way, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be called to him; and being arriued he asked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, what do you aske at my hands? They anſwered,
<hi>Lord that thou open theſe eyes of ours,</hi> and take this blindenes from vs; and at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant our Lord extended his hand to their eyes, and they obtained ſight both of body and ſoule; and they followed our Lord, being full of gratitude for ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and of faith, and deſire to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:23762:55"/>doe him ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Much is here to be conſidered in the admirable <hi>Benignity,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord did vſe towards theſe blind men; in that he would hearken to their cries; and they, being ſo baſe perſons, and our Lord ſo ſoueraignely high, that he would yet pawſe in the way, &amp; ſtay for them, and make all them alſo ſtay, who went with him; and condeſcend thereby to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of thoſe blinde men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate himſelf to their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For if our Lord had gone walking on, they not ſeeing the way could not haue followed him, or at leaſt, not faſt enough to ouertake him; &amp; he muſt haue giuen them much trouble in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to it. That way of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, was alſo full of impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and dangerous precipices, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> notes; and ſo if
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:23762:56"/>they had been put to goe a pace in ſuch a way, they had been in danger to receiue much hurt. For theſe reaſons did our Lord make a ſtand; as alſo becauſe he would vouchſaffe to doe them honour, making ſo much accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them, as for their reſpect to ſtay in that high way; and to make ſo much people ſtay with him. And beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, it was a great teſtimony of his <hi>Benignity</hi> towardes them, to graunt them at the inſtant of their asking it; and that with ſo much comfort to them, ſo great a benefit, as it was to receiue their ſight, both in body and ſoule, and ſuch deuotion, as carryed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on to glorify Almighty God.</p>
            <p>A great wonder it was, that <hi>Ioſue</hi> ſhould cauſe the
<hi>Sunne</hi> to ſtand ſtill, and make a pawſe in the heauen, to illuminate the earth, till ſuch time as he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <pb n="99" facs="tcp:23762:56"/>victory ouer his enemies; and that the <hi>Sunne</hi> and all the Orbes, which moued with it, ſhould ſtand ſtill, obeying the voice of
<hi>Ioſue,</hi> the ſeruant of God. But a much greater wonder it is, that our Lord who created both the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the whole machine of the world ſhould make a ſtand in the way, obeying the voice of a blinde begger, that he might il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate him both in body and ſoule, as the true
<hi>Sunne</hi> of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>A great <hi>Benignity</hi> it is, that a Kinge of any earthly kingdome paſſing on his way through a ſtreet, ſhould ſtay and make all the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of his Court ſtay with him, vpon the cry of a begger, who asketh almes; and that he ſhould expect that begger till he could arriue; and ſhould giue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his petion; and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, open a purſe with his owne <pb n="100" facs="tcp:23762:57"/>hands, and giue the begger what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer almes he had deſired. But a farre greater <hi>Benignity</hi> it is, that the King of heauen and earth ſhould deteine himſelfe in a high way, and ſtand expecting a poore begger, till he could arriue to him, and then ſhould aske him what he would deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

10. <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. ſeeing the power which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord had to cure all diſeaſes by touching ſicke perſons, brought thoſe little children to him; and not onely them who were able to goe vpon their owne feet, but alſo <pb n="103" facs="tcp:23762:58"/>their ſucking babes, who could not ſpeake nor goe, but in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of others; and they offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, that he might touch them, and giue them his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and they had confidence that by this meanes, ſuch of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as were ſicke, would recouer their health, and they who were not not ſicke, would continue whole. Their parents vſed this very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and with much importunity: for they who had children were many, and did ſo much eſteeme this good of their children, that no man would want it by his will; and euery one deſired to preuent his neighbour, and be the firſt to get a bleſſing for his ſonne. The Apoſtles ſeeing this, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that it was a thing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the authority and grauity of our Lord, to employ himſelfe vpon ſuch a light and meane
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23762:59"/>thing as this, and thereby to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater matters; &amp; thinking alſo, that becauſe the exerciſe was ſo frequent, and vſed with ſo great importunity, and ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by thoſe pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who brought their children, that our Lord would be troubled and vexed thereby; did vſe ſeuerely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch as brought the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and would ſhake them off, as threatening them; that ſo they might not come to our Lord. So ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> giuing a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof. The diſciples droue away the little children, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them to come to our Lord, in reſpect of his dignity, and the authority of his perſon. And S.
<hi>Hierome,</hi> declaring another reaſon ſaith; The diſciples thought, that as other men are wont to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, and diſpleaſed, by ſuch importunities; ſo alſo would our <pb n="105" facs="tcp:23762:59"/>Lord be, by the frequency and importunity, wherby they offred their children. And Saint
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> addeth another cauſe to this, and faith; The diſciples alſo did thus, leaſt otherwiſe our Lord might haue bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppreſſed, that is; much ſtraigthened and tired, by the multitude of people, which came to him; ſome thruſtling and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling others, by occaſion of the children who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they brought. Now our Lord perceiuing how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles hindred litle children fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> approaching to him, though he knew their zeale, and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith they did it, which was not ill; yet he liked it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not ſo agreable to the diuine ſpirit of the ſame Lord, but to the humane ſpirit of the diſciples. And ſhewing both by his countenance and his wordes, that he liked it not, he called &amp;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23762:60"/>reprehended them ſaying; <hi>Suffer little children to come to mee, and doe not hinder them; for of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</hi> I meane that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth belong, not onely to thoſe little children, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, innocency and grace they haue; but that the ſame kidgdom of heauen ſhall be alſo giuen to men, who in their practiſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſimplicity, and purity of life, will become like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And ſo for that, which little children are in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by diuine grace, which is, to be acceptable to God, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of heauen; and for that alſo, which they repreſent in others, namely to be men, who are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, innocent, and pure, whom I loue and eſteem much, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with my very bowells, and bleſſe with my gifts; therfore will I ſuffer them to approache to me, <pb n="107" facs="tcp:23762:60"/>and I will admit them to my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements, and bleſſings; and therefore ſee you giue them noe impediment in comming.</p>
            <p>Our Lord hauing thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended his diſciples, he called them who brought the children; and making thoſe children come neer him, he put his hands vpon their heads; and embraced them, and gaue them his holy bleſſing with his hands; &amp; with his words he recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father; and he made them partakers of his diuine grace, by the efficacy of his benediction.</p>
            <p>By this act, <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to vs his
<hi>Benignity,</hi> and moſt ſweet condition; in that a Lord of ſo great Maieſty, and who was euer e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ployed in ſo great and high workes, ſhould deſcend to a thing, which in all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was ſo poore and meane,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23762:61"/>and belonging wholly to men, who had no waighty buſineſſe in hand; and that he ſhould doe it, with ſo cheerfull a countenance, and with ſo much guſt, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that their parents, &amp; others of kinne who brought the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhould preſume to bring them ſo often, and ſo importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and to interrupt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his diſcourſes, and the working of his miracles; and to e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ploy ſo large ſpaces of time, in this ſo meane exerciſe.</p>
            <p>And not onely did <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord diſcouer his
<hi>Benignity</hi> to vs, by this proceeding; but he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it to be ſo great, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that it doth incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably exceed all that, which men can conceiue, and beleiue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For although it were much, which the Apoſtles knew of the <hi>Benignity,</hi> and piety, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23762:61"/>of our Lord; yet they could not beleiue or vnderſtand, how it could poſſibly arriue ſo farre as this; but did rather thinke; that our Lord was to diſdaine ſuch a poore imployment; and that he would be troubled, and offended by the diſquiet, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which they gaue him in this kinde. But indeed it was farre otherwiſe with him; for the meannes of the action pleaſed him much; and the time it coſt, was held by him to be well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; and the labour &amp; trouble which they put him to, was ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gladly endured by him.</p>
            <p>Let vs imitate this <hi>Benignity</hi> of our Lord, in deſcending to doe ſuch thinges as are poore, and meane in the account of men, when charity requires it at our hands; and to treate and conuerſe with poore, and meane people, <pb n="110" facs="tcp:23762:62"/>though wee may ſeeme perhaps to looſe ſomewhat of our right, and dignity thereby; if yet it doe import for the aſſiſting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them, in their neceſſities, &amp; for gaining them to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, doing that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did, in imitation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I haue made my ſelfe all thinges, to all men,</hi> I haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated my ſelfe to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and guſts of all men, in all lawfull thinges; thereby looſing ſomewhat of mine owne right &amp; liberty, that I might ſaue as many as I could.</p>

            <head>THE X. CHAPTER. <hi>Of the Benignity which Chriſt our Lord shewed towards wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who came to him with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt intention.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OVr Lord ſhewed great <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in yeelding ſo liberally and ſweetly to all that, which the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who came to him, deſired of him with good intention, and true deſire of finding remedy by his meanes; but he diſcouered it much more, in yeelding liberally to that which was deſired of him, with a corrupt minde, and with a meaning to calumniate him, and to drawe ſome word out of his mouth, or to note ſome action, wherby they might defame him, and condemne him to death.</p>
            <p>There came to him a man of <pb n="112" facs="tcp:23762:63"/>the Lawe
<hi>Luc.</hi> 10. after a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit manner, to tempt him; and he asked him,
<hi>what he was to doe for the obtaining of eternall life?</hi> but our Lord did not diſcouer his treachery, nor reprehended his wickednes, but graunted that which he deſired, inſtructing him with wordes full of ſweetnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of what he was to know and doe, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of eternall life.</p>
            <p>There came a Phariſee to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. who was learned in the Lawe, to aske him which was the greateſt commaundment of the Lawe; and he came, with a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minde and not with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to vnderſtand the truth, but to finde matter, whereof to accuſe him. And yet he without ſhewing any feeling or diſguſt, either in his countenance, or wordes, did anſwere to the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with much <pb n="113" facs="tcp:23762:63"/>facility &amp; ſuauity, and he taught him the truth.</p>
            <p>The Phariſees did often inuite him to eate with them,
<hi>Luc.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. not with charity, but with a peruerſe and malitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; which was to ſee if he did or ſaid any thing, which might be taxed; and finding nothing whereof they could take hould wherewith to hurt him, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to ſerue themſelues of his piety and religiouſnes towardes the making good their ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and therefore they inuited him vpon their Sabboth daies, and would place ſicke perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; to the end that curing them vpon the Sabboth, they might accuſe him for not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it. And our Lord knowing the malice, and wicked intention wherewith they inuited him, did not yet excuſe himſelfe from <pb n="114" facs="tcp:23762:64"/>going; but with great facility graunted the ſuite they made, &amp; accepted their inuitation; and he went to their houſes, and did eate with them, and comfort them by his preſence, &amp; illuminate them by his doctrine, and edify them by his example. And though he vſed moſt exact temperance in eating and drinking; yet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelfe to them, &amp; to ſhew himſelfe affable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne towards them, he fed vpon thoſe ordinary meats, which they vſed. And euen this was a proofe of his very vnſpeakeable <hi>Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that coming into the world to ſuffer for man, and carrying ſuch an intenſe loue towards the Croſſe, and ſuch a moſt ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to abſtaine from all earthly comfort, and regalo; and to take all that to himſelfe, which was moſt painfull and grieuous, that <pb n="115" facs="tcp:23762:64"/>ſo he might ſuffer the more for man, and ſatisfy the diuine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice more perfectly, and diſcouer and exerciſe that loue ſo much the more, which he carryed both to the eternall Father, and to the whole race of mankinde; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles, he did in many things remit much of this rigour at ſome times, and did both in his feeding and cloathing, ſerue himſelfe of ordinary and vſuall things; ſo to ſhew himſelfe more appliable, and ſweet towards them with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he conuerſed and fed; &amp; to make himſelfe more inuitable by all men, and to giue them all, the greater hope of their ſaluation. So ſaith the venerable Abbot <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius.</hi> It was fit that our Lord who came to take away finne, ſhould be benigne and ſweet, and that he ſhould accommodate himſelfe to the weakenes of men <pb n="116" facs="tcp:23762:65"/>to gaine them for heauen, as he did; and for this cauſe he went to the table of ſinners, and fed vpon their meates; though he did it in a moſt temperate and religious manner, as it becometh holy men to doe. And although at times, he condeſcended thus to the vſuall cuſtome of men for the winning of them; he did not for all this, giue ouer his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of auſtere and painfull life, which he alſo exerciſed at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times; as namely during thoſe forty daies, which he faſted in the deſert.</p>
            <p>This was ſaid by <hi>Euthymius;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, that ſo to admit of the inuitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinfull people, and eſpecially ſuch as did inuite him with a malitious minde, as if it had been but to eate with them, was a worke of ſupreme <hi>Benignity,</hi> whereby he ſhewed his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23762:65"/>moſt ſweet loue; in the ſtrength whereof, he had a meaning to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſaue all the world.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially he ſhewed this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable <hi>Benignity,</hi> in the time of his Paſſion. For being in the houſe of Caiphas,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. before that Councell of vniuſt Iudges, &amp; they asking him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wore <hi>Christ</hi> and the Sonne of God or no; &amp; our Lord ſeeing that they asked it not with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of knowing the truth, or for the doing of Iuſtice, but onely from his anſwere to take occaſion of blaſpheming him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him to death, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to Pilate, to the end that he might execute that vniuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which they had giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And obſeruing, that by reaſon they were ſo wicked, &amp; ſo vaine, and proud, they were moſt vnworthy of any anſwere; <pb n="118" facs="tcp:23762:66"/>yet neuertheles that ſoueraigne Maieſty of
<hi>Christ,</hi> the Kinge of glory refuſed not to giue them anſwere, and diſdained not to ſpeake to them; but in very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt wordes, was content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them, who he was by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus; Herafter when my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is at an end, the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God; which was as much as to ſay, that he was to raigne, &amp; diſcouer his power, and authority as he was God, coequall to the eternall Father. And they enducing another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion hereupon, ſaying;
<hi>Therefore belike thou art the ſonne of God;</hi> he anſwered alſo to that, ſaying; <hi>your ſelues ſay that I am ſo,</hi> which was to anſwere truth: but with very modeſt, and humble words; whereby though he gaue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in very truth he <pb n="119" facs="tcp:23762:66"/>was the Sonne of God, yet he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it not expreſſely, as it was fit not to doe to ſuch as would not profit by it, though the anſwere had been more expreſſe &amp; cleer. And by anſwering them after this manner, he alſo ſhewed his inclination to anſwere them more plainely, and directly to what they asked, if they would haue knowen the truth, to haue beleeued it. And this he ſignified by ſaying. If I tell you what you aske, you will not beleeue mee; and if I aske you any thing, to the end that I may teach you truth, you will not anſwere mee.</p>
            <p>Our Lord by anſwering theſe queſtions, which were asked by Iudges ſo wicked, ſo cruell, and ſo vndeſeruing of any reſpect at this hands, did ſhew how free his heart was from all paſſion, and choler; ſince he anſwered with ſo <pb n="120" facs="tcp:23762:67"/>great ſerenity, &amp; peace of minde; and therby he preuented that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion which they would haue caſt vpon him, if he had been wholly ſilent; and he diſcouered the
<hi>Benignity</hi> and ſweetnes of his imme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe charity towards his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſince he obeyed them, who had noe right of commaundme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ouer him, and ſatisfied their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes who were ſo vnworthy of all anſwere.</p>
            <p>Let vs follow the example of <hi>Benignity,</hi> which here our moſt bleſſed Lord and Sauiour giues vs, and not onely let vs loue our enemies, as wee haue already ſhewed: but let vs alſo be benigne towards them; and let vs grant them, what they deſire when it may lawfully be done; conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to their diſpoſition and inclination in lawfull thinges; and ſpeaking to them humbly, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:23762:67"/>and modeſty, and ſhewing them the loue of our hearts, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire wee haue to giue them guſt, and contentment, in ſuch things as are agreable to the wil of God.</p>
            <p>This doth our Lord himſelfe expect, and aduiſe vs to, by Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> ſaying; Loue your enemies, and do good to them: and if they deſire to borrow money of you, or any other thing, affoard it without hoping after any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. And when there is need, giue with a free hand, without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any other reward, then of Almighty God; and ſo the reward which God wil giue you for ſuch workes, will be very abundant and great. For you ſhall be the ſonnes of the moſt high God, who is benigne, euen to men who are vngratefull and wicked; and though they be vnworthy of his benefits, and breakers of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundments, <pb n="122" facs="tcp:23762:68"/>&amp; worthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments, yet he ceaſeth not to doe them good.</p>

            <head>THE XI. CHAPTER. <hi>Of the Benignity, which wee are to vſe towards our neighbours, doing them honour by good wordes; and of the examples which Chriſt our Lord gaue vs herein.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe vertue of <hi>Benignity,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that a man ſhould be courteous, and well mannered in the wordes, he ſpeaketh of his neighbour; and that both in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and abſence, he doe him honour by his manner of ſpeech. For <hi>Benignity</hi> maketh a man ſweet and ciuill in his diſcourſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, ſticking cloſe to the end of charity, which is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and eternall good. And a <pb n="123" facs="tcp:23762:68"/>principall part of this ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation doth conſiſt, in that the wordes be ciuill and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; whereby wee may honour our neighbour, according to the quality of his perſon and ſtate: and for this reaſon, a man who vſeth curteſy, is called benigne, and gentle, and he adorneth his neighbour with good wordes. There are men, who being gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſpirit of this world, or els by their naturall condition (not corrected by reaſon,) vſe to ſpeake of their neighbours, with little eſtimation of them, &amp; when there is a latitude of giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a title more honourable, they giue him the leaſt they can, ſo it be without offence to the quality of his perſon. And whereas they might treate them in better ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, they proceed in ſuch ſorte, as to ſhew little eſtimation of <pb n="124" facs="tcp:23762:69"/>them, and ſo they trouble and greiue them. And eſpecially they ſpeake of their neighbours, when they are abſent, in wordes which ſhew they make little account of them; and thereby they thinke to exalt themſelues, &amp; to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more eſteemed by others; but they are deceiued. For in that they do not the thing, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by charity, <hi>which is benigne and sweet,</hi> they obtaine not that which they pretend, which is to be eſteemed and honoured; but they are deſpiſed, and diſpraiſed for it. For eſtimation ſpringeth from loue; and if you loue a man, you eſteeme him: and ſo on the other ſide, contempt ſpringeth from hate; and to abhorre a man, is to deſpiſe him. And ſo when a man is wel conditioned, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his wordes, towards his neighbours, he is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23762:69"/>and for the ſame reaſon all men reſpect, eſteeme, and honour him: for they loue a man, who loueth them; and they eſteem &amp; honour, ſuch as eſteem, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them. But when a man is diſcourteous in his wordes, and appeareth to make ſmall account of his neighbours, he is abhorred by all men; or if they doe not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre his perſon, yet they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre his condition, &amp; diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous language; and for the ſame reaſon, he is little accounted of, and deſpiſed by all.</p>
            <p>This is taught vs by holy ſcripture ſaying; <hi>A ſweet and gentle word, doth reconcile, and winne the hearts of men,</hi> and makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their friends, and multiplieth others, and doth ſweeten &amp; appeaſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>and a benigne and gratious to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue doth abound in a good man.</hi> The meaning is; it produceth an abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <pb n="126" facs="tcp:23762:70"/>fruite in the heart of others, mouing them alſo to be benigne, and to ſpeake gently &amp; ſweetly, to ſuch as ſpeake gently &amp; ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them. The holy Ghoſt ſaith of the ſeruant of God, that he is well mannered, and curteous in his wordes; and this is that diuine fruite, which he produceth in his neighbours, to make them meek, and <hi>Benigne,</hi> as himſelfe is. And of him, on the other ſide, who is rude, &amp; diſcurteous in his words, the Holy Ghoſt alſo ſaith; <hi>The stroke of a whippe, maketh the flesh blacke, and blew; but the blow of an ill tongue, breakes the bones;</hi> that is to ſay; it doth many times hurt, and wound the ſoule, in ſuch ſort, as to cauſe is to fall into ſorrow, and impatience, &amp; hatred, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſtrength, and vigour of that grace and vertue, which it had, is loſt. This hurt, doth a <pb n="127" facs="tcp:23762:70"/>diſcurteous &amp; vnmannerly word, which wanteth <hi>Benignity,</hi> produce in the ſoule of man.</p>
            <p>Of this kinde of <hi>Benignity</hi> in ſpeech <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord did leaue vs moſt excellent examples, in his holy Ghoſpell: They brought him one day, a man in his bed who was a paralitike, &amp; breaking through the roofe of the houſe, they placed him before him; <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. and our Lord, behoulding the faith of them, who brought him, did him ſo particular a fauour, that he efficaciouſly moued him to a great ſorrow for his ſinnes, and to haue faith in our Lord, &amp; confidence that he ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen. And being then in ſo good a diſpoſition, he pardoned them, and ſo he declared himſelfe to doe, by ſaying, <hi>Sonne, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> This man being ſo miſerable in his corporal ſtate, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:23762:71"/>and being ſo baſe of condition, as that he might without ſhame, carry his couch vpon his backe, and being a ſinfull man beſides, (for as Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> notes he had contracted his diſeaſe by his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) and coming to the preſence of our Lord with the vncleannes of thoſe ſinnes, by the waight whereof he was oppreſſed (for there they appeared to haue been take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him by our Lord;) the ſame Lord being the creator of all things did yet call him <hi>Sonne;</hi> which is a title of great ſweetnes of loue, and ſheweth ſuch equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in condition, as runnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fathers, &amp; ſonnes. So high a Lord, doth honour and exalt ſo baſe a man, ſo farre; that in ſome ſort he maketh him equall to his Angells, and Saints by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him the name, and title of his Sonne. For this is the great <pb n="129" facs="tcp:23762:71"/>dignity &amp; honour, which Saints and Angels haue, to be the ſonnes of the moſt high God. So doth S.
<hi>Hierome,</hi> note ſaying; O admirable humility of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, that to a contemptible and defeated man, without ſtrength or health in any part of his body, whom the Prieſts of the lawe would haue deſpiſed, and diſdained euen ſo much as to touch, our moſt <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And leauing many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Saints, to whom he hath done it, ſometimes in the forme of a childe, and ſometimes of a moſt beautifull young man, &amp; ſometimes of a moſt glorious perſon; and hath honoured and comforted them, both with words and deedes, of muſt ſweet loue: Wee will ſpeake here, of one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable apparition, and that of great authority, whereof we haue made ſome mention elſwhere, to another purpoſe; and in reſpect <pb n="137" facs="tcp:23762:75"/>it was vouchſaffed to a perſon of very meane quality it doth ſo much the more diſcloſe the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and makes vs the more confident of his goodnes. Saint <hi>Paulinus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Nola, relateth how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſhips going from Sardinia towards Italy, grew into a great tempeſt, cloſe by the Iland; and the reſt of them breaking, and ſinking there, one of them which was fraught with corne, did not ſplit, but yet was extremely ill treated by the ſtorme. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, did all leaue her, and left alſo in her, an old poore man of Sardinia, who was yet no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but had begun to be cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed in that faith; and it was his office to clenſe, and pumpe the ſhip. When the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obſerued him ſelfe to be alone, and in a ſhip which had neither anker nor <pb n="138" facs="tcp:23762:76"/>ſterne, (for ſhe had loſt all, in the tempeſt:) he began with teares to recommend himſelf to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and to beg remedy at his hands. He paſſed in this anguiſh, ſix whole daies, without eating any thing, and ſtill continuing in this affliction, <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord appeared to him in great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and beauty, and comforted him and fed him, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to cut the maſt, which was the ordinary remedy, wherof the ſhip ſeemed capable, in that extremity. For though our Lord was reſolued to deliuer the poore man, yet he was pleaſed withall, that he ſhould alſo do his part. He put himſelfe therfore, to cut the maſt; and becauſe he alone was not able to doe it, the Angells of heauen helped him in it. When this viſit was at an end, and the man had diſpoſed himſelfe to <pb n="139" facs="tcp:23762:76"/>ſleepe, our Lord came againe and appeared to him, and gently tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his eare with his hand, and gently pulling it, he waked him, and required him to goe about the doing of thoſe things, which were neceſſary for his nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and in that which himſelfe could not doe, he had the aſſiſtance of the Angells. Another time, he appeared to him, ſitting in the pupp of the ſhip, where the ſterne is wont to be; letting him ſee that it was he, who gouerned her. The good man came to the feet of our Lord; and perceiuing, that he vouchſaffed to be ſo familiar and <hi>Benigne</hi> towards him; &amp; that he did ſo cheriſh, and inuite him to himſelfe, he tooke great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and confidence, and bent his head downe, ſometime to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſacred feet, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repoſed it in his boſome. <pb n="140" facs="tcp:23762:77"/>Our Lord departed then, hauing both by word and deed, affoarded thoſe great fauours and regaloes of ſo great <hi>Benignity,</hi> to this old Catechumenus. And the ſhip, being directed, and conducted by the fauour of heauen, ſailed three and twenty daies by ſea; and and paſſing by Africke, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily, and by the Faro of that Iland, he came at laſt to the coaſt of Lucana, which is the lower part of Calabria. There the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants did receiue him, and were all eye witneſſes of the miracle; ſeeing him come ſafe in a ſhip, which was all defeated, without ſterne, or men to gouerne her. From thence they conducted the old man to Saint <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who receiued him with great loue, and baptiſed him; and whereas firſt his name was
<hi>Valgius,</hi> he called him now by the name of <hi>Victor.</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:23762:77"/>And the Saint affirmes, that this was a very well conditioned, and a ſincere innocent kinde of man, and that he would recount this benefit, and apparition of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, with ſo great te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dernes, and deuotion, that whoſoeuer heard him, could not chooſe but weepe from the heart.</p>

<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord himſelfe, and raiſed by him vp euen to the third heauen; and choſen out to iudge all the Nations of the Gentiles, yea and the very Angells with them, in company of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord; and being ſo employed, both day and night in preaching the Ghoſpell, and gouernment of the Church, as that <hi>in his brest he carryed the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, and care of all the particular Churches thereof;</hi> that ſuch a man I ſay as this, ſo venerable to the Inhabitants of heauen, and ſo reuerenced here on earth; ſhould <pb n="150" facs="tcp:23762:82"/>take ſo much to heart, and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate at ſo great leaſure, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of a fugitiue ſlaue, but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerted to the faith; as that he ſhould write a letter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome to <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which was in <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> where his Maſter was dwelling in Coloſſus, and recommend him to be receiued, to be pardoned, and to be treated well. And not being contented to performe this office of charity in ordinary wordes (which yet had been ſufficient,) that he ſhould honour
<hi>Oneſimus</hi> with termes of ſo great eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loue and ſweetnes; and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to his Maſter in termes, and with reaſons, of ſo great exaggeration, as a Father would do, recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his only ſonne, whom he did extreamely loue, to ſome great friend of his.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Benignity</hi> and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy and ſuauity of ſpeech, which <pb n="151" facs="tcp:23762:82"/>the Apoſtles learned of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, and this muſt all faithfull Chriſtians imitate, treating our neighbours with termes of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy, and good manners; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moſt honourable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and names we can, according to the eſtate of euery one, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of that people amongſt whom wee liue, in ſpeaking honorably of them, both in preſence and abſence.</p>
            <p>In this ſorte wee ſhall preuent many ſinnes, which we vſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, for want of obſeruing the rule of charity. We ſhall free our ſelues from detraction and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, which is a vice through which a man contemnes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts his neighbour, ſpeaking ill of him, and recording his defects and faults, whether it be with truth, or with falſhood. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer this is a vice much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <pb n="152" facs="tcp:23762:83"/>by Almighty God, and very abhominable to them who feare him; which made Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> ſay, <hi>detracters, who are abhorred by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</hi> And the wiſe man in the Prouerbes, ſaith. <hi>The murmurer who ſpeaketh ill of his neighbour, and maketh a ſcorne of him, is abhominable to men.</hi> And becauſe when God hath abhomination towards a ſinner, it is to wiſh him the euill of eternall paine; from hence it is that the murmurer is ſubiect to eternall malediction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus chap.</hi> 28. ſignifieth, ſaying. <hi>The murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who ſecretly ſpeaketh ill of his neighbour, and who hath two tongues,</hi> (becauſe in the preſence of his neighbour he ſpeaketh well of him, and in his abſence he infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him by ill report) <hi>is accurſed both of God and man;</hi> becauſe he hath giuen trouble to many, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing <pb n="153" facs="tcp:23762:83"/>priuing them of the peace, and quiet of their hearts; and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with grief and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and deſtroying that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good correſpondence, which they had with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall alſo deliuer our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues by this meanes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſinne of contumely and reproach; into which they fall, who face to face giue ill wordes to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; whereby they vnderualue, and affront them; and this is the vice of them who want iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the wiſe man affirmeth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>He who ſpeaketh contumelious words to his neighbours, is a foole.</hi> And in another place, all fooles are apt to thruſt themſelues into ſuites, and ſtrifes, and ſuch other buſineſſes, as tend towards the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting of others; or els to the being affronted by others, with <pb n="154" facs="tcp:23762:84"/>iniutious wordes. And this is ſo grieuous a ſinne, and ſo worthy of puniſhment, as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord ſaid; <hi>He who shal cal his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour foole,</hi> with a minde to affront him, is <hi>worthy of eternall fier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee ſhall alſo thus excuſe our ſelues from curſing others, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men offer their neighbours to the diuell, that they may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or els, whereby they deſire them any other euil. Which ſinne is ſo grieuous, as that it excludes men from that glory, to which they were created, as the Apoſtle ſignified 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. when he ſaid; <hi>They who curſe men</hi> (deſiring the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that with their heart, which they ſay with their tongue) <hi>shall not poſſeſse the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our ſelues from theſe ſinnes ſo pernitious to the ſoule, which are committed by <pb n="155" facs="tcp:23762:84"/>the tongue, if we be well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and <hi>benigne</hi> in our words; whereby wee honour our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in their preſence, &amp; ſpeake not ill of them in their abſence. And together with this wee ſhall, by the good vſe of our
<hi>benigne</hi> ſpeech, giue great guſt to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and ſhall deſerue much in his ſight; and wee ſhall winne the loue of our neighbour, making them friendly, and kinde to vs; to the end that they may willingly receiue any good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and counſell from vs, which wee ſhall thinke fit to giue. And wee ſhall conſerue the peace, and ſtrength of our owne ſoules, yea and of our eſtates alſo for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteining of our liues; which many times is loſt, by the ill gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our tongues; and finally wee ſhall edify our neighbours, by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our good words.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:23762:85"/>All this was ſignified by the wiſe man, when he ſaid; <hi>The peaceable and quiet tongue, is a sweet tree of life.</hi> Which ſignifieth that it recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and comforteth the hearts of men, and giues them ſpirituall life, and ſtrength; and frees them from the mortall diſtempers of anger, and hatred, and other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And this is wrought by that man, who giueth good language, thro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ugh the much gaine and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they get in the ſight of Almighty God. And in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, who heare the good ſpeech which is vſed by any man of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, worketh the like effect; for thereby they are edified, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced towards a loue of vertue.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SOme Chriſtians there be, who are very courteous, and well conditioned towards their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as long as thoſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours treate them with the ſame curteſy and ciuility; but if their neighbours faile towards them, they alſo faile; and then they treate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy and diſgrace, wherewith they are treated, and they vſe the ſame ill termes which are vſed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is no good, but an ill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For, that I ſhould be well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned towards my neighbour, becauſe he alſo is ſo to mee, is no loue of charity, but a loue of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23762:86"/>intereſt, and concupiſcence; and that I ſhould faile in curteſy, and good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition towards another, becauſe he falles ſhort therin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, is not the vertue of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> but it is the vice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. That which charity and <hi>Benignity</hi> requires, and which God exacteth at our hands, is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though another man do not what he ought, yet I doe; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though another man ſhould faile of vſing me with due curteſy, yet that I faile not thereof towards him. For by this meanes, it wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that in the ciuility, which I vſe towards my neighbours, I am not moued by humane reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; but for the loue of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God: and that I pretend not proper honour or intereſt, but the glory of Almighty God, and the profit of my ſoule, and the edification of my neighbour. And
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23762:86"/>in this ſorte I being of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſhewing curteſy tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards him, who doth not ſo to me, I ſhal pleaſe almighty God much the more: for I ſhall moue more purely for the loue of him, and ſhall exerciſe more vertue, and encreaſe merit, and gaine more reward in the ſight of God.

This was taught vs by the Apoſtle Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> with a kinde of heauenly inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion; aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
<hi>Benignity</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in ſuffering iniuries, with

            <p>IT is much to be noted concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this vertue of
<hi>Benignity,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord taught vs, both by his word, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; that there are ſome, both ſayings and deedes of

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this <hi>Benignity;</hi> but which yet are not contrary, but very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable <pb n="162" facs="tcp:23762:88"/>thereunto.

And now wee will goe declaring ſome inſtances, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord left vs of this truth, in the holy Ghoſpell.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Luke chap.</hi> 13. relateth, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:23762:88"/>that our Lord being then, as it ſeemed, in Galile, which was the iuriſdiction of
<hi>Herod,</hi> ſome of the Phariſees came and ſaid to him; <hi>Auoid this country for Herod hath a minde to kill thee.</hi> Our Lord made them this anſwere; <hi>Go tel that foxe, that he may ſee I cast diuells both out of bodies and ſoules, to day and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that the third day I shall dy, and by ending my life giue end and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to theſe workes of mine.</hi> By theſe <hi>three dayes,</hi> our Lord vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the time of his whole life; and ſometimes he called that, <hi>one day,</hi> and ſome other times
<hi>three daies;</hi> to ſignify the ſhortnes of this life; and to ſignify alſo, as wee ſaid before, that as no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuention or meanes was able to make the natural day one minute ſhorter then it is; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any meanes to ſhorten his life, by one minute. <pb n="164" facs="tcp:23762:89"/>And therefore the ſubſtance of what he ſaid was this. During all that time of my life, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee by the determination of my eternall Father, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe in this world, and doe thoſe workes, for which he ſent mee; which is to teach truth, &amp; to caſt diuells both out of bodies and ſoules, and to beſtow both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall health vpon men: and as long as this time ſhal laſt, neither <hi>Herod,</hi> nor any other power vnder heauen, ſhall be able to take my life from mee. But when the houre ſhall be come, which is determined by my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I wil offer my ſelfe to death, to giue perfect life and health to the world. Yet this I will not doe in <hi>Galile,</hi> but in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> For as it is not fit, that any Prophet dy out of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo eſpecially is it decreed of this Prophet (who for <pb n="165" facs="tcp:23762:89"/>his eminency and excellency is called <hi>The Prophet</hi> which is the <hi>Meſsias</hi>) that he ſhall dy in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> And as for the reſt of the Prophets, it hath ordinarily been true, and ſo alſo it will bee, that they haue been put to death and are to dy in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> becauſe in that Citty, the wickednes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who gouerne the people doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Herod,</hi> who was called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipas,</hi> was a very wicked Kinge, and very ſcandalous. He was an adulterer, and an in ceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for he tooke his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife from him. He was a murtherer, &amp; a ſacrilegious man; for he had taken away the life of the great Saint
<hi>Iohn Baptist;</hi> and as it ſhould ſeem he alſo went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to murder <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord ſecretly; leaſt the people, being inſtructed by his holy doctrine, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:23762:90"/>might growe to abhorre
<hi>Herods</hi> wicked life. He was alſo a moſt vaine, giddy creature; for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the dance of a girle, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the one halfe of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if need had been; and he paid the life of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> for it. He was moreouer a falſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling perſon, for he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he murdered Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> for the complying with his oath; whereas indeed that was not the cauſe, but for the contenting of a wicked woman, and for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſecuring of his owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, reſoluing to diſcouer the authority of the Kinge of heauen and earth, and of the Lord of al creatures, which himſelfe had in his hand, for the reproofe, and puniſhment of all the powerfull men of this world; and to ſhew how free he was from
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23762:90"/>all humane feare; and to giue an example to the Prelates of his Church, of that holy liberty, which in ſuch caſe they were to vſe, towards the Kinges of the earth; and to diſcouer alſo, how vile, and contemptible, ſinnefull men are, in the ſight of God, how rich, and noble, and great Lords ſoeuer they might chance to be, and particularly meaning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them, who bad him take heed of <hi>Herod,</hi> that he knew well enough all the fetches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of that crafty man, &amp; that he had no need to be tould ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by any other: I ſay to declare and diſcouer all theſe thinges, he ſpake this word; <hi>Tell that foxe &amp;c.</hi> Which was to ſay vnder a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor; Tell that crafty, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling man, who by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of his life, giues a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent odour of ill example, that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23762:91"/>whatſoeuer e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deauour he may vſe, he can take no part of my life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee, till my ſelfe ſhall volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily part with it; as I will do, when the time ordained by my eternall Father, ſhall arriue.</p>
            <p>Being therefore moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, for theſe ends which wee haue touched, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord ſhould ſpeake with this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Lord, he did yet obſerue great modeſty and <hi>Benignity</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For he might well haue ſaid; Tell that wicked man, that adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, that murderer, and ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſon; yea or tell it to that diuell (for all this had fitted him, &amp; he deſerued it well:) but <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord would not vſe any of theſe termes, but fell vpon a more moderate word, as this was; <hi>Tell that crafty and diſſembling man, that he hath no power to stop the courſe of my life.</hi> And ſo ſhewing the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23762:91"/>and holy liberty which the Prelates of the Church are to vſe towardes the great men of this world; and diſcouering alſo, his owne diuine wiſedome; he did joyntly teach vs that moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherewith we are to exeroiſe that authority and liberty.</p>
            <p>Other examples; which may breed the like difficulty in the mindes of ignorant men, are the reprehenſions which <hi>Christ</hi> out Lord gaue to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> of the people of
<hi>Iſraell,</hi> in very ſeuere wordes, which did greatly confound, and grieuouſly wound them; for he would ſay ſometimes, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.
<hi>You genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vipers, you can not ſpeake well being ſo wicked. This wicked &amp; adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> asketh ſignes:</hi> At other times he would ſay, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. <hi>Woe be to you Scribes and Phariſees you hipoctites. Wo be to you, who are <pb n="170" facs="tcp:23762:92"/>blinde, and guides of the blinde.</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. <hi>You are of the diuell, and him you haue for your Father, and you coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate to his wicked ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee the myſtery of theſe words of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, &amp; how they were not contrary to that <hi>Charity</hi> and
<hi>Benignity,</hi> which he taught vs, but full of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the ſame. And let vs alſo ſee, who they be, who may vſe ſuch wordes; and to what kinde of perſons; &amp; for what ends they may be vſed.</p>
            <p>The Scribes and Phariſes, who were the Doctours, and ſhould haue been the true Religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> were at that time, not onely wicked, but wicked they were in all extreamity, and their ſinnes were very publicke, &amp; very contrary to all Religion. And with being ſo wicked, they yet would needes ſell themſelues for <pb n="171" facs="tcp:23762:92"/>good, and holy; and they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied their wicked life, with ill precepts, which were moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the people. For by their wicked life, and peruerſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and with their pretences and deceits, they corrupted the manners of ignorant people; and they were blind &amp; obſtinate. And beſides theſe ſinnes, which were ordinary in them, they harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſupreme wickednes, of hindering the ſaluation, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord came to worke, in the ſoules of men; calumniating his moſt holy life, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Belzebub,</hi> thoſe moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and expreſſe miracles, which he wrought by diuine power; and perſecuting him to whom they ſhould haue carryed all venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and exhibited al obedience, as to the true <hi>Meſsias;</hi> and yet deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and procuring by all the

            <p>Theſe men being ſuch as I haue ſaid, it was neceſſary that
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, (who was ſent by his Father to giue teſtimony to the truth, and to take ſcandalls out of the world, and to giue remedy to ſoules) vſing the authority, which he had, of Sauiour of the world, &amp; King of heauen, ſhould reprehend vice; and that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning publicke ſinnes, he ſhould reprehend them publickely; and that concerning grieuous &amp; very hurtfull ſinnes, he ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them grieuouſly, according to the quality and perniciouſnes of the ſame: that ſo they, who were faulty, might well feele the great hurt they did; and all the reſt of the people, might be diſabuſed, and not haue cauſe to follow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ill exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, or ill precepts <pb n="173" facs="tcp:23762:93"/>of their wicked Teachers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. And now that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord might execute this ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant office for the ſaluation of ſoules, which was ordeined to the ends of true <hi>Charity,</hi> ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his were neceſſary, as might declare the grieuouſnes of the hipocriſy, and other ſinnes of thoſe Teachers, and the hurt they did to the people; and the damnation which they prouided for themſelues, by committing ſuch ſinnes: and he tould them, who was the principall Author thereof, namely the diuell, whom they obeyed; and the neceſſity which they had, of making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſtrong remedies; for they were ſinnes which were inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited from their predeceſſors, who had been wicked, and they were deeply rooted in their hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, did eſpecially <pb n="174" facs="tcp:23762:94"/>make ſuch ſeuere and ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, when they did falſly ſooth, and flatter him. For many times, when they darted out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious words againſt him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not; but anſwered them with all ſweetnes, ſhewing his humility, and meekenes, and teaching vs to ſuffer wrongs, with patience. But when they flattered him, he reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them indeed: as when with counterfeit hearts, they ſaid, <hi>Maſter, wee deſire a ſigne of thee from heauen;</hi> for then he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them thus.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>You wicked and adulterous generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And when they ſaid, <hi>Maſter wee know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God according to truth.</hi> For then he ſaid, <hi>why doe you tempt mee, you hipocrites?</hi> diſcouring therby, that he vnderſtood their hearts, and that he would not pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with their flatteries, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23762:94"/>praiſes; and teaching all the world, that wee were not to take guſt in being ſoothed, nor to deſire to be praiſed by men. So did S. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> obſerue vpon theſe wordes, <hi>Maſter wee deſire that thou giue vs a ſigne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen.</hi> Where he ſaith, that firſt they iniured him, ſaying, <hi>he had a diuell;</hi> and that then they flattered him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, <hi>Maſter.</hi> And therefore it is, that he reprehendeth them with vehemency, ſaying, <hi>that they were a wicked generation.</hi> So that, when they affront him with ill words, he anſwereth them with meekenes; and when they flatter him with a falſe heart, he giues them ſharpe wordes. Our moſt bleſſed Lord diſcouering to vs thereby, that he was free from all paſſion; and that neither he was put to impatience by affro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; nor that he was inueigled by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>

            <head>THE XVI.

            <p>BEſides theſe reaſons, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord did ſo ſharply reprehend the ſinnes of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Phariſes, there is yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and it is for the inſtructing of the Prelates of the Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the ſinnes of publicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and rebellious ſinners, which are of the more grieuous ſorte, and more preiudiciall to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that they are to doe it publickly, with great weight, and <pb n="177" facs="tcp:23762:95"/>force of words, to the end that obſtinate ſinners may finde how wicked they are; and that they may reforme themſelues, and that others may feare, and take warning by their ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that all ſinnes, and ſinners are not to bee repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after the ſame manner, but ſome gently and ſweetly; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with ſeuerity and rigour, according to the quality of the ſinne, and the obſtinacy of the ſinner, &amp; the hurt which he doth thereby to others. And that theſe ſeuere reprehenſions, which are made in puniſhment of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, muſt not be vſed by all, but by Superiours, who haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the ſame; and that the end which ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue, muſt not be the affront, nor the trouble of the ſinner, but the reformation both of him, &amp; others. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="178" facs="tcp:23762:96"/>
               <hi>Charity,</hi> which teacheth vs to be ſweet, and benigne, towards ſome kinde of ſinners, (becauſe that courſe is fit for the good of their ſoules) the ſelfe ſame
<hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> teacheth vs, to be ſeuere and ſtrict towardes others; becauſe that alſo is conuenient, to the and that others may be warned, and they reformed. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> noteth this, in theſe words. Some offences are to be reprehended with vehemency, to the end that the delinquent, who of himſelfe perhaps, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſnes of his ſinne, may come to finde it by the wordes of him who reprehends; and that he may growe to feare the committing of that ſinne, which he thought to be but light, by the very ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wherwith it is corrected. And it is the duty of the Superiour to correct with great ſeuerity thoſe <pb n="179" facs="tcp:23762:96"/>offences of their ſubiects, which are not gently to be endured; but he muſt not doe it out of anger, but out of a holy zeale; for feare, leaſt if he correct not faults as he ought, himſelf grow to be faulty; and that the puniſhment which was due to the offences of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, doe fall vpon himſelfe through his negligence. And the ſame Saint ſaith in another place; that their ſinnes who haue not loſt ſhame, are to be reprehended after another ſorte, then theirs who haue loſt all ſhame. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion is neceſſary for the reformation of them, who are growne impudent; but ſuch as are ſtill aſhamed of their ſinnes, are vſually better reformed, by ſome milde exhortation.</p>
            <p>This ſtile, of ſeuerely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the more griouous; and pernitious ſorte of ſinnes, which <pb n="180" facs="tcp:23762:97"/>haue been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull men of this world, and by the falſe guide of ſoules, hath been obſerued by the auncient Saints, who were mooued to it by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and the Saints alſo of the Euangelicall Lawe, haue vſed the like, being inſtructed by the example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord; though it be true that theſe later, haue obſerued it with greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and more mixture of ſuauity then the former; for ſo the Lawe of <hi>grace</hi> requires.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 12. <hi>chap.</hi> reproued Kinge <hi>Dauid;</hi> and hauing firſt propounded him a parable, he concluded ſaying; Thou art that man, who hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>The great <hi>Baptiſt</hi> of our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. reprehending the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Phariſes &amp; Saduces, who came to his Baptiſme, ſaid thus to them. <hi>O you generation of vipers.</hi> You men full of the venime of ſinne, and that ſo inueterate, as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23762:98"/>that you haue inherited it from your Fathers; who hath forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you to fly from the wrath &amp; iuſt vengeance of God? What wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And Saint <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 8. reprouing
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> ſaid. <hi>Thy money perish with thee;</hi> in that thou thoughteſt, that the gift of God, which is imparted by the Holy Ghoſt, was to be bought with money. I ſee that thou art full of the bitternes, and gall of ſinne, &amp; that thou art bound faſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to euerlaſting torments. And Saint <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. ſaid to <hi>Elimas</hi> the ſorcerer.
<hi>O man full of falshood, and deceit, thou ſonne of the diuell, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:23762:99"/>enemy of all Iuſtice, who forbeareſt not to doe thy vttermost, to peruert the straight waies of the lawe of God.</hi> And Saint
<hi>Steuen</hi> ſaid, to the Scribes, and Phariſes. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>O you ſtiffe nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and who haue not cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wickednes of your hearts, and of your cares, with the sword of the word of God: You haue euer reſisted the holy Ghost, as your forefathers did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner haue the Saints (with that authority, which they had from God for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to comply with the duty of that office which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them) reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded thoſe men with ſharpe and ſeuere wordes, who by their wicked life, and the deceit and falſehood of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe doctrine, had corrupted ſoules. And they were moued to reprehend them thus, by their great <hi>charity,</hi> in their loue to God,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:23762:99"/>and their neighbours; and by a moſt ardent zeale to the glory of God, &amp; the good of ſoules. And it is a thing very worthy the being conſidered, that whereas the Saints doe ſometimes vſe ſuch wordes in their reprehenſions, as haue been expreſſed, they are not indeed affronting or iniurious wordes, when wee conſider the heart, and end wherewith, and for which they are ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; though yet they may ſeeme ſo be to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the very ſame, which paſſionate men are wont to vſe, when they affront others, and reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge themſelues of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Whereby wee may be ſure, that theſe holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not ſpeake thoſe words with paſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to giue diſgrace, as theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe; but with zeale of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and deſire to doe good. And by this rule which followeth wee <pb n="186" facs="tcp:23762:100"/>ſhall diſcerne it plainly.</p>
            <p>If they, who reprehend their neighbours, ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue authority, with ſharpe words, in caſes when there is neceſſity to doe it; if they, I ſay, (abſtracting from thoſe caſes of neceſſity, and in all things els, which they doe and ſay) ſhew themſelues hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meeke and full of pitty both louing, and doing good to their neighbours, and deſpiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſuffering the iniuries and ill treaty, which they receiue from others, with patience; wee may cleerly ſee, that when they ſpeake ſharply to ſinners, they do it not out of pride, or paſſion, or to put diſgrace vpon them; but only out of a charitable deſire to recouer, and cure their ſoules. For the men, who when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ſinners, ſpeake words with inward paſſion, and out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23762:100"/>doe the like when that is not the caſe, &amp; they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues reuengefull, angry, and proud: but holy men proceed not ſo; but when that neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ceaſeth, they vſe al men with much humility, and charity; and eſpecially thoſe very perſons, whom they reprehended. Wee ſee this by the examples which wee produced before.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Nathan</hi> reprehended <hi>Dauid</hi> with ſo great liberty; yet when he ſawe him reformed, he went in to him, and caſt himſelfe vpon his knees, &amp; ſpake to him, and treated him with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Though <hi>Elias</hi> reprehended <hi>Achab</hi> ſo ſharpely, yet after, when the Kinge was in his chariot, <hi>Elias</hi> himſelfe went running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, in his company, with much humility, as if he had been a meer ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his. And though <pb n="188" facs="tcp:23762:101"/>
               <hi>Elizeus</hi> confounded the pride of <hi>Ioram</hi> with ſo great a reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet inſtantly with great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he did miraculouſly obtaine water of God, both for him, and all his army.</p>
            <p>Though the man of God did ſo ſeuerely reproue, and threaten
<hi>Ieroboam;</hi> yet ſeeing that the King had one of his handes dried vp, he beſought God with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and obtained health for him. Though the great <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist,</hi> did with ſo vehement words, declare the malice of the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> and <hi>Saduces;</hi> yet he did it but by way of admiration, and praiſe of the power, and goodnes of God, who had moued ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and blind ſinners to make ſome change of their liues; and inſtantly with great charity, and zeale, for the ſaluation of their ſoules, he exhorted and animated <pb n="189" facs="tcp:23762:101"/>them, to doe workes, worthy of penance, to the end that their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion might proue ſolid and with perſeuerance. And though <hi>Saint Steuen</hi> did ſharply reproue the
<hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſes;</hi> yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly he prayed to Almighty God for them, with a moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of loue, euen whileſt they were ſtoning him. And though S. <hi>Peter,</hi> did with wordes full of weight, deteſt the Simony of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> yet inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly being full of pitty, he admoniſhed him to doe penance, to the end that God might pardon that great wickednes of his. And though <hi>S. Paule</hi> did checke thoſe great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and the peruerſe life of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> the ſorcerer, yet inſtantly he vſed much charity towards him. For obtaining firſt, that God would ſtrike him blind, he would not haue that blindnes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, <pb n="190" facs="tcp:23762:102"/>as the wicked man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; but onely that it might laſt for a while: that ſo, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by that puniſhment he might come to vnderſtand his owne ſinne, and ſo doe penance for the ſame.</p>
            <p>In this ſort haue the Saints diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered cleerly, that thoſe ſharpe reprehenſions, whereby they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected grieuous finnes, were vſed by them with great tendernes, &amp; ſweetnes of loue; and that, whileſt in the exteriour, they ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo ſtrict, and free in their reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they did euen then, in the moſt interiour of their own hearts, humble and deſpiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> noteth in theſe wordes. Holy men doe not ſhew themſelues ſo reſolute, and free, when they reproue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull men of this world, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming vpon themſelues, nor to <pb n="191" facs="tcp:23762:102"/>the end that men ſhould render and ſubmit themſelues to them through the feare of man; but the great rectitude of heart, which they haue, makes them vſe that holy liberty; &amp; euen whileſt they vſe it, they conſerue themſelues in humility; and reprehending the crimes of ſinners, with great ſtrength of mind, they iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, examining their owne faults with great curioſity and care, and they place themſelues in their owne account below all others. This is ſaid by Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</hi> And by this true explication which wee haue made, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very cleare, that the ſerious and ſeuere reprehenſions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord &amp; his Saints haue corrected the great crimes of ſinners, are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that <hi>Benignity</hi> which he taught vs, but are full of the dearnes &amp; ſweetnes of true

            </head>
            <p>ONe of the principall things (beſides thoſe whereof wee haue ſpoken) which belong to the vertue of <hi>Benignity,</hi> and the ſweet manner of conuerſing with our neighbours is, to be glad of their good, and to praiſe them; yet with that moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence requireth, and to that end which <hi>Charity</hi> ſeeketh. For this maketh a ſeruant of God to be amiable and ſweet, and thus he augmenteth <hi>Charity,</hi> towards his neighbours, &amp; he groweth more <pb n="193" facs="tcp:23762:103"/>able to be of vſe to ſoules. For by this meanes, his inſtruction and admonition, will be the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and the example of his good life better allowed: and he will haue more efficacy to moue others. So ſaith the worthy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and Biſhop
<hi>Guiltelmus Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſienſis. Benignity</hi> is the loue of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others good; and wee call thoſe men <hi>Benigne,</hi> who as ſoon as they diſcouer a good thing in their neighbours, doe inſtantly loue it, and loue him for it; and from hence it growes, that they praiſe, and ſet him forth in wordes.</p>
            <p>For the exerciſe of this vertue, there is need of great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much diſcretion, and light from heauen. For as by the vſe therof with moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being directed to the right end, it is of great profit, and edification to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the encreaſe of vertue; ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23762:104"/>vſing it without moderation, and without rectitude of intention; it is both very hurtfull to his ſoule, who praiſeth, and to his alſo who is praiſed. For this reaſon, Saint <hi>Bonauenture</hi> approueth this ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> praiſe that with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is praiſe worthy; &amp; diſpraiſe that, which is blamable, with more moderation. For ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of praiſe is liable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as well as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate diſpraiſe.</p>
            <p>Well then, let vs goe on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the errour, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the hurt which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by inordinate praiſe and the manner &amp; intention which praiſe muſt haue, to the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it may be truly giuen according to vertue.</p>
            <p>For a man to praiſe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for that which is naught, is a great ſinne; and not onely doe they fal into it, who praiſe a man for ſome reuenge, which he may <pb n="195" facs="tcp:23762:104"/>haue taken of an enemy; or for hauing affro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that perſon, who did him iniury by ſome word, or for hauing vttered ſome carnall ſpeech, performing ſome actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that kind: but they alſo who praiſe ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous buildings, ſuperfluous humours &amp; gifts, curious &amp; rich cloathes, delicious &amp; coſtly dyet; and all that which hath any tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of vanity and pride, and the regalo of this fleſh &amp; blood, and the loue of the world. For all theſe thinges, are ill, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the ſoule of a Chriſtian; who, to the end that he may get to heauen, <hi>must deny himſelfe, and imbrace the Croſſe of Chriſt our Lord.</hi> To all theſe flatterers who praiſe that which they ſhould reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, <hi>Eſay chap.</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>Woe be to them, who praiſe wicked thinges, as if they were good; and who hould the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of errour for the light of truth; and <pb n="196" facs="tcp:23762:105"/>true light for darkenes; and who esteem the bitter life of ſinners, to be sweet; and the sweet life of vertue, to be bitter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, it is vitious for a man to praiſe temporall, &amp; naturall thinges, as if they were the greateſt, &amp; principall gifts of God; as riches, nobility, ſtrength, and beauty of the body. For theſe are bleſſings of little value, and they make not a man to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in himſelfe, or more eſtimable in the ſight of God: &amp; ſuch praiſe breeds much hurt to the ſoule, for it makes a man greatly loue and praiſe thoſe thinges which he ſhould deſpiſe, &amp; from which he ſhould eſtrange his heart. The holy ſcripture condemneth this vice ſaying, doe not praiſe men for the corporall beauty which they haue; nor deſpiſe them for their poore, &amp; meane apparance. Conſider that the Bee, being but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23762:105"/>a very little creature, giueth ſo excellent a fruite, as that it is the moſt ſweet of all ſweet thinges; for there is nothing more ſweet, then hony. The meaning is, that as the little Bee, hath efficacy to produce ſuch a fruite; ſo may a little body, &amp; a meane preſence, haue much vertue. And that which the Holy Ghoſt ſaith of the beauty of the body, he will haue vs vnderſtand of all other naturall, and temporall gifts, which are of ſo little value, that a man is noe further worthy of eſtimation or praiſe for them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he had them not; but onely ſo farre forth, as there may reſult ſome profit to the ſoule thereby. This was taught vs, both by the example, and diuine wordes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord: For a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing ſeen his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and hauing heard his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <pb n="198" facs="tcp:23762:106"/>was not able to conteine herſelfe, but that ſhe muſt needes praiſe that <hi>Mother</hi> aloud, who had brought forth ſuch a <hi>Sonne,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe, which have thee, and the brests which gaue thee ſucke.</hi> But
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord gaue her this anſwere; <hi>Nay, rather bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they who heare the word of God, and keepe it.</hi> By which wordes he diſcouered to vs, how that free &amp; gratuite bleſſing, whereby the moſt ſacred Virgin was made Mother of the naturall Sonne of God, did not alone, and of it ſelfe make her happy or bleſſed, nor worthy of the reward of heauen: nor more great in the ſight of God; but the vnſpeakeable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſuauity, and grace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Almighty God did exalt, and dignify her, for ſuch an office: &amp; that which afterward he gaue her, in regard of ſo high a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <pb n="199" facs="tcp:23762:106"/>was the thing which made her ſo truly happy.</p>
            <p>If then ſo admirable a gift, as that was, did not deſerue great praiſe for it ſelfe alone, but for that vertue and ſanctity which went in company thereof: how much more, muſt all temporall bleſſings, and gifts of nature, which in themſelues are ſo poore and periſhing, be vnworthy of praiſe; but onely ſo farre forth, as they may be found to aſſiſt, and concurre towards the good of the ſoule?</p>
            <p>So ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring theſe wordes of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord. By this ſentence, <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord did make vs know, that it would not haue profited the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> to haue brought forth the Sonne of God, if ſhee had not withall, been endowed with that faith, and incomparable ſanctity <pb n="200" facs="tcp:23762:107"/>which ſhee had. And therefore, as I ſaid, if ſo great a dignity, would not haue profited the <hi>bleſſed Virgin,</hi> without the vertue, and ſanctity of her ſoule; how much more clear is it, that it will ſerue vs to little purpoſe, before Almighty God, to haue Saints to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or ſonnes, or kinred, or ſuch other externall gifts; if withall, wee haue not goodnes and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and doe not lead a ſpirituall life? For this is that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men to be of value, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe, in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>It is alſo an errour, and fault of flattery, to praiſe our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for any vertue, which he may haue, and thereby to delight and comfort him principally, for the temporall gaine and profit, which he hopeth to receiue of him. For the praiſe of true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which principally is to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined <pb n="201" facs="tcp:23762:107"/>to ſome ſpirituall good, and to the ſeruice of God, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by him to his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate intereſt, which is a ſinnefull thing; &amp; ſo much the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous it will be, as there is more inordinatenes in the thing. And when it is very great, that will be fulfilled in their perſons, which is ſpoken of by the Pſalmiſt,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. God will defeare and deſtroy, the ſtrength and authority of them, who deſire and procure to pleaſe, and giue guſt to men: and haue that for their end, not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp towards God, but downe vpon their owne priuate intereſt and humour. Eſpecially they who procure to pleaſe worldly men, forbearing to doe thoſe thinges which they owe to God, in reſpect of them: theſe indeed, ſhall be confounded, and put to ſhame, by Almighty God. For both in <pb n="202" facs="tcp:23762:108"/>this life, euen all their temporall hopes ſhall prooue vaine; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in the other life, they ſhall be fulfilled with ſhame, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer to eternall torments.</p>
            <p>Beſides it is a defect, and the fault of ſoothing, to praiſe a man either for his wit, or learning, or for the talents, and parts which he hath: yea or euen for his true vertue; when it is likely, that through his weakenes, or vnmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ill inclination he may fall into pride, and vaine complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in himſelf, or into any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of his ſoule. Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerued this, in theſe wordes. A hard thing it is, that ſome little impurity of errour, doe not ſtick to the hart of a man, (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though it be cleane) vpon the praiſes of another; vnles indeed he ſhould haue it ſo very cleane, as that be ſhould take no guſt in them, nor <pb n="203" facs="tcp:23762:108"/>be touched by any vapour of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and vnles the praiſe which they giue him, ſhould more content him for the good of them, who praiſe him, then for the comfort, or honour, or eſtimation, which may growe thereby to himſelfe. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may know, that their praiſe of him, is profitable to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if in their life they honour not him, but God; not faſtning their mindes vpon him, by the praiſe, &amp; honour, which they giue him, but riſing vp by him, towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whoſe moſt ſacred temple euery man is, who liueth well. So that it may be fulfilled in him, which is ſpoken of, by the Pſalmiſt; My ſoule ſhall be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch, as are good; not in it ſelfe but in our Lord; that is to ſay, for the gifts which it hath of our Lord, and for the glory of the ſame Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:23762:109"/>This is the danger to which they are ordinarily ſubiect, who are much praiſed by men; vnles they be poſſeſſors of true and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid vertue, whereby they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt vaine complacence, and refer the praiſe to the Author of all good thinges, which is God. For ſo ſaith the holy Scripture; <hi>Better is it, to be corrected by a diſcreet and wiſe man, then to be praiſed by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent man, who with his ſmooth kinde of praiſing leaues vs in errour.</hi> And declaring the danger wherin man is, when he who praiſeth, doth not obſerue the moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and end which ought to be kept. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaid; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which doth ſo eaſily infect, and corrupt the hearts of men as flattery; and the tongue of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer doth more hurt, then the ſword of a perſecutour.</p>
            <p>Another fault is alſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="205" facs="tcp:23762:109"/>in praiſing ſome, when it is for the diſpraiſe of others. A man will not dare expreſſely to ſpeake ill of his neighbour, eſpecially to one who hath auerſion from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it; and therefore to doe it the more couertly, he doth it by meanes of praiſing another man for the ſame vertues and gifts of his, and then the detracter would haue it thought, that the man whom he meaneth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe, doth want thoſe vertues, or elſe is ſubiect to the contrary defects. Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> noteth this vice, in theſe wordes: We doe many good thinges; but not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with a good minde. Wee praiſe many; but not to the end, that we may ſpeake well of them, but to detract and ſpeake ill of others. Now that which wee ſay is good, becauſe we praiſe vertue in another; but the minde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <pb n="206" facs="tcp:23762:110"/>with wee ſay it, is infected with ſinne, and ſet on worke by Satan: for wee pretend not to doe him good, whom wee praiſe, but hurt to him whom wee diſpraiſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the defects, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which growe by praiſinge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when it is done without diſcretion and moderation; and without that end to which it ought to be addreſſed; and ſo it leaueth to be vertue, as is turned into the vice of flattery. And now wee will declare, how praiſe is to be vſed, to the end that it may be a fruite of the vertue of
<hi>Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Benignity.</hi> And wee will produce ſome examples, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord ſhewed vs, concerning the manner and intention, which we were to hould in praiſinge our neighbours,</p>

            <head>THE XVIII. CHAPTER. <hi>Of the intention, and moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are to praiſe vertue in our neighbours: and of the examples which Christ our Lord gaue vs thereof.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a thing both lawfull and very pleaſing to Almighty God, for a man to praiſe his neighbours, for the good he hath done; to the end that being prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they may loue vertue ſo much the more, and be animated to the exerciſe thereof; and not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied by the troubles, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to which a vertuous life is ſubiect. And this is principally to be done, towards men, who are but beginners in the way of vertue; and who are weake, and of little heart; for ſuch perſons <pb n="208" facs="tcp:23762:111"/>haue the greater need of helpe. Yet euen this praiſe muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the moderation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; in ſuch ſort, as that it may profit, and not hurt the party praiſed; but may edify, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to a loue and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue, and not to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in himſelfe, and a loue of vanity. For the obtaining of this end, the praiſe muſt be giuen in words, which may not greatly exaggerate, or amplify the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but plainly declare the truth, and his approbation thereof. Let vs ſee ſome exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, which <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord gaue of this. <hi>Nathaniell</hi> came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. being brought to him by Saint <hi>Philip.</hi> This
<hi>Nathaniell,</hi> was a man full of vertue, &amp; very obſeruant of the lawe; and came in doubt, whether or no <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord were the true
<hi>Meſtias,</hi> as S. <hi>Philip</hi> 
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:23762:111"/>had ſaid he was. And drawing, neer, our Lord looked vpon his diſciples, and ſaid in the hearing of <hi>Nathaniell: Behould here a true Iſraelite, in whom there is no guile.</hi> As if he had ſaid; Behould here a man truly good, not diſſembling or counterfeit; but that vertue which he ſheweth in his exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour faſhion, and publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, which is ſubiect to the ſight of men, is poſſeſt by him in the ſecret, &amp; moſt interiour part of his heart, which is ſeen by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
            <p>This was a true, and moderate praiſe, and much good grew to
<hi>Nathaniell</hi> by it; for therby he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord knew the ſecrets of his heart, and he was certified of it ſo much the more, by the further anſwere of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord. For ſaying to him, <hi>where knew you mee?</hi> he anſwered, <pb n="210" facs="tcp:23762:112"/>
               <hi>I ſawe thee, when thou wert vnder the ſigtree.</hi> It ſhould ſeem that
<hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,</hi> had retired himſelfe vnder that tree to pray, or to doe ſome other good worke; and ſo he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring thereby, (as a wiſe man might well doe,) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord knew all thinges, he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued perfectly in him, and tooke him for his Maſter. Let vs deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer another example of the ſame truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. came into the houſe of
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican; and he mooued him by his wordes, and by his preſence, to ſo great pennance, and change of life: that not onely he reſolued to giue ouer all thoſe ſinnes into which he had fallen, &amp; to reſtore all that, to the reſtitution wherof he was obliged; but to render it foure fould; thereby giuing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the fault he had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23762:112"/>mitted, by voluntarily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the paine, which the lawe impoſed vpon ſuch perſons, as tooke away the goods of others; and beſides all this, he gaue halfe his ſubſtance to the poore.
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord perceiuing ſo good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of a holy life in
<hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> did praiſe him: by ſaying of him, to the ſtanders by;
<hi>This day, is true ſaluation wrought in this houſe;</hi> For the Maſter and owner of it, is already a true ſonne of <hi>Abraham:</hi> not only now by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of fleſh and blood; but by the imitation of his faith, and vertue. In this ſorte therefore, did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord praiſe <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,</hi> who was a new beginner in his ſchoole of vertue and good life, and ſo alſo did he praiſe <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus.</hi> And the praiſe was true, and moderate; &amp; it did no more then declare in plaine wordes, that the <pb n="212" facs="tcp:23762:113"/>one of them, was a man truly good, and the other truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; by meanes of theſe words, he ſtrengthned and encouraged them, both to perſeuer and grow in the good courſe which they had begunne.</p>
            <p>But not only did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord praiſe them, who had good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, &amp; who were truly good; and vpright and well meaninge ſoules, as <hi>Nathaniell</hi> already was before, and <hi>Zacchaus</hi> was growne to be; but he approued, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo that good which was ſaid, or done, by ſuch as came to him, euen with an ill minde. There came a man, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. who was lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Lawe, to tempt him, asking
<hi>what he was to doe, for the obtaining of eternall life? Christ</hi> our Lord demaunded of him, <hi>how it was written in the Lawe?</hi> He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>It is written that thou shalt loue <pb n="213" facs="tcp:23762:113"/>the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Our Lord the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid to him, (by way of allowing &amp; praiſing what he had formerly ſaid;)
<hi>Thou haſt answered well: doe as thou hast ſaid, and as the Lawe commaundeth, and thou shalt obtaine euerlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There came, another time, a Phariſy to our Lord, <hi>Mat. 22. Marc.</hi> 12. in name of all the reſt, to ſee if he could draw ſome ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere from him, as whereby he might calumniate him; and he asked him, <hi>which was the greateſt commaundment of the law?</hi> And
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, hauing anſwered him, <hi>that it was to loue God with all the heart;</hi> the Phariſy approued the anſwere of our Lord, and added thereunto theſe words: <hi>that to loue God with all the heart; and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ones ſelfe, was a better worke and more acceptable to God, then all <pb n="214" facs="tcp:23762:114"/>the Holocausts and other Sacrifices of the Lawe.</hi> Then our Lord liking the ſpeech of this man, did praiſe him ſaying;
<hi>Thou art not farre from the kingdome of God.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay; Thou art not farre from beleeuing, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ghoſpell, and obteining true ſaluation. For the knowing of a diuine truth ſo important, and the approouing it by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall gift of God, was a diſpoſition for the being conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him: and to acknowledge
<hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe, who was ſent into the world to ſaue it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt our Lord, if he would haue encreaſed his Iuſtice, vpon theſe two learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Law, might haue ſeuerely reprooued the ill mind, wherewith they were come to him; and he might haue diſcouered the craft, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, which they carryed in their <pb n="215" facs="tcp:23762:114"/>hearts; for ſo alſo they would haue vnderſtood, that he knew all things, and thereby he might haue put them to confuſion and ſhame. Yet this he would not do; but he heard them with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meekenes, and anſwered their queſtions with ſupreme <hi>Charity.</hi> And he approoued that which they had ſaid well, though it were very little, and very imperfect; and he praiſed it with ſtrange <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity:</hi> that ſo he might remooue that peruerſenes of minde from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they brought to him; and encourage them to encreaſe in the knowledge and loue of truth, till at length, they might grow ſubiect to it. And ſo by this true <hi>Benignity,</hi> he changed their hearts, and ſent them bettered from him; and he taught vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that not only we are to praiſe good men, for the true vertue
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:23762:115"/>which they haue, but that we may alſo praiſe with moderation, euen in imperfect and wicked men, the good they doe or ſay; to the end that they may growe to take af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to vertue, and may ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and driue out of their hearts, the wickednes which they haue, and goe encreaſing in the good way begunne; as alſo to gaine their good will; &amp; to make them beneuolous and kinde; which is a very good diſpoſition, towards the inducing them to receiue in good part the doctrine, which we ſhall deliuer, and the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we may haue cauſe to vſe. And therefore Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> aduiſeth, that when they who are endowed with authority, and wiſdome for this purpoſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue ſinners, who are puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; weak, they ſhal do wel to mingle ſome ſweetnes of praiſe, <pb n="217" facs="tcp:23762:115"/>the ſharpenes of correction; that ſo they may the better admit of the doctrine and reproofe, which is giuen them. The Saint expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it in theſe words. Wee ſhall better drawe ſuch ſinners, as are not peruerſe &amp; proud, but weake and poore of heart, to the way of heauen, if whilſt we reprehend the euil thinges, which they haue done, wee ioyntly praiſe thoſe good thinges, which wee know to be in them; to the end that by this meanes, ſuch praiſe may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and ſtrengthen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their weakenes, who were humbled by that reproofe. Thus did S. <hi>Paule</hi> proceed with thoſe Chriſtians of

            <head>THE XIX. CHAPTER. <hi>How wee must praiſe vertue, for the making it be more eſteemed: and of the examples which Christ our Lord gaue vs to this purpoſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WEe muſt alſo praiſe the vertue of good men, to declare how great a good that is; and how that which ſeemeth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and of meane value in the ſight of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is indeed very great, and hath a moſt high reward in the ſight of God; to the end that other men may eſteem greatly of it, and carry much affection to it, &amp; labour hard to acquire it. Let vs deliuer ſome examples hereof.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Peter Matt.</hi> 16. confeſſed to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord that he was the true Sonne of God ſaying; <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the liuing God.</hi> 
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:23762:117"/>It ſeemed a ſmall matter, and of no merit, that Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> hauing conuerſed ſo long with <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, &amp; ſeen with his owne eyes, ſo great and ſo euident miracles, and heard ſuch doctrine, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated ſuch an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of life; that he ſhould piouſly incline his heart to belieue, that he was the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> &amp; the naturall Sonne of God. For this did not coſt him the ſhedding of his blood, nor the tormenting of his body with affliction, and penance; but only to produce a pious affect of the will, and to performe an act of obedience in the vnderſtanding. But <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord praiſed him, and gaue teſtimony that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act of his was of ſupreme value and eſtimation, in the ſight of Almighty God; and that on earth he ſhould receiue admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fauouurs from God for the <pb n="222" facs="tcp:23762:118"/>ſame; &amp; that in heauen, he ſhould enioy an imme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe reward of glory. And that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he might begin to be happy by that certen hope, and pawne, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him of that infinite good, which he was afterward to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, and enioy during all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All this he declared by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Bleſsed art thou Simon the ſonne of Ionas.</hi> for men who are made of fleſh and blood, were not able, with al the humane wiſdome they haue, to teach thee this truth. My celeſtiall Father it is, who hath reueiled it to thee, &amp; vpon thee, will I build my Church, and to thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>By theſe words, <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord praiſed by faith and deuotion of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> and declared to the world, of how ſoueraigne value before Almighty God, and how <pb n="223" facs="tcp:23762:118"/>richly to be rewarded with cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall and eternall bleſſings, one ſingle act of vertue may be, which is performed by a iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though it be eaſily produced, and in a ſhort time, and how little ſoeuer it may coſt; and eſpecially an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour act of liuely faith, which a iuſt man hath no difficulty at all to performe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, being in the Atrium of the Temple
<hi>Marc.</hi> 12. <hi>Luc.</hi> 21. behoulding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who were eaſting almes into the cheſt, which was to ſerue for the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Temple, for the maintenance of the Prieſts, and for the relief of the poore; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt of them who caſt in their almes, which without doubt was then done both by many and in plentifull manner (for it was neer Eaſter, at which time there came much people to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> from <pb n="224" facs="tcp:23762:119"/>all parts;) there cometh a very poore widow, and caſteth into the cheſt, two of the leaſt little peeces of money or mites. Our Lord ſeeing her and being pleaſed to praiſe her much, for the act which ſhee had done, and the almes which ſhee had giuen, called his diſciples, and pointing out the woman ſaid thus to them. <hi>This widow hath caſt a greater almes into the cheſt,</hi> and made a greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Temple, <hi>then all the reſt, who haue giuen almes this day.</hi> And our Lord ſhewed diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why ſhee had giuen more then any of them. Firſt, becauſe in proportion of her poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it was more for her to giue a mite, then for others to giue ſtore of crownes. And becauſe the reſt gaue the almes out of that which did aduance beyond their neceſſary maintenance; and that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:23762:119"/>they gaue not all, but a part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but this widow gaue that which was neceſſary to her ſelfe, and ſhee gaue it all. But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reaſon which he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſignify vnder this was, for that ſhee gaue her almes, with a greater affection and deſire to giue, and with more ardour of charity then al they; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by her hauing giuen all that ſhe had, being in preciſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof, for her owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
            <p>In this ſorte did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord praiſe the almes of this poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and by praiſing her, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to all the children of his Church, how highly the good worke of a iuſt perſon is valued, in the ſight of Almighty God; &amp; the great account he makes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and how he will reward it in heauen; and how he meanes not <pb n="226" facs="tcp:23762:120"/>to giue the reward according to the quantity of the worke, but according to the good will and loue of God and our neighbour, wherewith it is performed. He will alſo haue vs learne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, firſt to eſteem greatly of the good works, which our neighbours do, how litle ſoeuer they may be; and and approue them and praiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before men, for their edification; and much to value thoſe good men, who doe them, though they be poore, &amp; of meane condition and eſtate; ſince God, who ſees their hearts, doth prize them much. And ſecondly, he will haue vs learne by this, to be animated towards the doing of good works, and to exerciſe the acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and charity, with much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and deſire to pleaſe God; and to doe more then wee doe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by reaſon of our weaknes, <pb n="227" facs="tcp:23762:120"/>and our little talent, either of vertue, or goods, or power any other way, our workes be very ſmall; ſince God hath regard to the good will, wherewith they are done, &amp; to the pious heart, from whence they proceed.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this example of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord.

And being poore they were all, according to their weake power and ſtrength, ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in giuing, that they did very abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly diſcouer the pure intention which they had therin, and their great promptitude, and euen hunger and thirſt to giue,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23762:121"/>&amp; to pleaſe God by doing all the good, that poſſibly they could, to their neighbours. And I giue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to this truth, that not only they gaue willingly all they could, but more then they could; for not onely gaue they of the ſuperfluity, and that which they could conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſpare, but they gaue part of thoſe very thinges, which were euen neceſſary for the very ſupport of their liues.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, hauing praiſed in theſe wordes, the Charity and mercy of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement of this example, to doe the like; and he ſaith, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what the Chriſtians of <hi>Macedonia</hi> haue done, I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my ſelf to ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Titus</hi> to you, that this grace which he begun in you, may be finiſhed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by his exhorting, &amp; mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <head>THE XX. CHAPTER. <hi>How it is fit to praiſe the vertue of ſome, thereby to correct the vice of others.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ANother way, which makes our praiſing others to be very profitable for vs, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to almighty God, is to praiſe the vertue, and good workes of them, from whom no ſuch thing had been expected; and thereby to conuince and confound thoſe others, who were not ſo vertuous, and did not worke ſo well, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter helpes, and were in greater <pb n="232" facs="tcp:23762:123"/>obligations then the former. Let vs declare this by an example.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Centurion</hi> (that is to ſay a Captaine of a hundred ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) in <hi>Capharnaum, Matt.</hi> 8. <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. placed there by the Romans; and a Gentile he was, who deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not from Patriarches, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but from Gentiles &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and from people who had noe knowledge of the true God. This man, by meanes of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which he had with the Iewes, came to know this truth, that there was one God; and he had taken an affection to his holy Lawe, and to his people of <hi>Iſraell;</hi> and he loued &amp; cheriſhed them, and built a Sinagogue for them, vpon the vnderſtanding which he had, that of all the men in the world, theſe were the profeſſors of true Religion. This
<hi>Centurion,</hi> had a ſeruant whom he greatly <pb n="233" facs="tcp:23762:123"/>loued, who fell ſicke of a pleuriſy, &amp; was growne to the very point of death. And the ſeruant being in thoſe termes, and the Maſter hauing heard of the miracles which had been wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, he conceiued a great confidence and faith, that if he deſired remedy for that ſeruant, he ſhould obtaine it; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued with great aſſurednes, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a Lord ſo powerfull, that euen in abſence, he could giue him the life, and health of his ſeruant, by the onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment of his word. Not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming therfore to appeare in the preſence of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, (as holding himſelfe vnworthy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) he interpoſed the auncient, and prime men of the Iewes, for interceſſours. Theſe men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the name of the
<hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> deſired that he would goe to <pb n="234" facs="tcp:23762:124"/>his houſe, and cure his ſeruant: inſtantly our Lord put himſelfe vpon the way, to doe as much as they deſired. As ſoon as the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> knew that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord was comminge to his houſe, he tould him, by meanes of the ſame interceſſours, that in no caſe he was to doe it; for that himſelfe was vnworthy of ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but he onely prayed, that from thence, he would commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by ſome one word of his, that his ſeruant might be cured; and that that would ſerue for his recouery. And this he confirmed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his owne perſon; for if he, being a weake man, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of another, (who was the Generall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) could yet commaund his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to diſpoſe themſelues here or there, and that accordingly, and inſtantly the thing was done;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:23762:124"/>how much more could <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, being ſo abſolute, and of ſo great power, commaund from whereſoeuer he were, that ſicknes and death ſhould be gone, and that health and life ſhould come; and that they would not faile to obey him.</p>
            <p>This man, diſcouered great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in not preſuming once to to appeare in the preſence of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, but to negotiate by meanes of the Iewes, whom he held for better then himſelfe; and by thoſe wordes, he alſo ſhewed a great faith. And ſo <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, hauing heard this meſſage, ſhewed to be in admiration, to ſee ſo great faith in a Pagan ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. And turning his countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the troupe of Iewes, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, he ſaid; <hi>Verily I ſay to you, I haue not found ſo great faith as this, in Iſraell. And many shall come
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:23762:125"/>from the Eaſt, and from the West, and from all the parts of the world, out of the nations of the Gentiles,</hi> and by meanes of faith; and obedience to my Ghoſpell, <hi>shall ſit in company of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarches; and ſhall raigne with God: <hi>and</hi> on the other ſide, they who be <hi>the children of the kingdom,</hi> which are the Iewes, who deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d from the Patriarchs, and to whom the promiſe of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> and of his celeſtiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was made, <hi>shall</hi> the moſt part of them <hi>be excluded from that Kingdome, and shut vp into eternall torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord praiſed the faith of the
<hi>Centurion,</hi> for the reproofe of the infidelity of thoſe Iewes, who belieued not in him at all; &amp; of the weak faith of ſome others, who belieued in him; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them by this example; and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:23762:125"/>to mooue them to penance for their fault, and to perſwade with them, who belieued not; and to encreaſe their faith who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And ſo he was pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe to this effect; This <hi>Centurion</hi> being a Gentile, and not hauing read the Prophets, nor hauing been brought vp in the Lawe of God, nor in any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but of the warre, and not hauing ſeene my workes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but onely heard relation of mee; hath beleeued my truth, and my power, with ſo great and ſo firme a faith; and on the other ſide, the children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> who are deſcended from the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; who haue read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and know the Prophecies, which ſpeake of mee; and who were looking for mee, and haue ſeen my miracles, and heard my doctrine, ſome of theſe, haue not <pb n="238" facs="tcp:23762:126"/>belieued in mee, nor will receiue my truth, but perſecute the ſame; &amp; others haue beleeued it ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, that none of them hath arriued to ſo great a Faith as this man hath, and as he confeſſeth in honour of mee. They I ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many cauſes &amp; motiues, which they haue had, to beleeue my truth with a perfect faith, haue not beleeued it, as they ought: and this man hauing had ſo few motiues, as he had to beleeue in me, hath beleeued with ſo great perfection, that he hath farre outſtripped all the reſt. And therefore this man, though but a Gentile; and all the other Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les alſo, who throughout all the parts of the world, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to mee, and ſhall be like this man in his faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to my word, ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23762:126"/>in company of the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, whom they haue imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; and on the other ſide the children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> who according to the extractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fleſh &amp; blood, deſcend from Patriarches; if they doe not penance, and reforme their infidelity and diſobedience, by true and conſtant faith, and reall ſubiection to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundments, ſhall be excluded from the Kingdome of heauen, and condemned to eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>In this ſort did <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord praiſe the faith of the <hi>Centurion;</hi> and thereby did he correct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, or at leaſt the weake faith of the Iewes. And he did it with much reaſon; for the faith of this man was ſo great, that ſome of the Saints conceiue, that he did truly know, and beleeue the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord; and that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23762:127"/>it was couered with the veile of his ſacred humanity. For thus ſaith Saint <hi>Hierome.</hi> The wiſdome of the
<hi>Centurion</hi> is diſcouered, in that with the eyes of faith, he ſaw the diuinity which lay hid vnder that veile of humanity. And the ſame doth Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> confeſſe, ſaying, in the perſon of the ſame
<hi>Centurion;</hi> If I, being a man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to others, haue yet power to commaund; how much more haſt thou it, ô Lord, whom all the powers of the earth obey and ſerue?</p>
            <p>Wee are to profit by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch ſeruants of God, as liue in a more eminent degree of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, then the ſtate and condition of their life ſeemeth to exact at their hands; for the admoniſhing and correcting of others, who, by reaſon of their vocation, and of <pb n="241" facs="tcp:23762:127"/>the parts and gifts which God hath beſtowed vpon them, were obliged to greater vertue. As when, for the correcting of ſome Prelate, who may be ſtraight han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in giuing almes, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent withall, in the gouernment of his ſubiects, we may praiſe ſome Lord, who being a ſecular man, is yet moſt liberall in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing almes, and moſt vigilant in procuring that his ſeruants and vaſſailes may be vertuous. And as if, for the reproofe and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Religious man, who were remiſſe in making Prayer, and doing Penance, and were full of tepidity in the exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and imperfect in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his
<hi>Obedience,</hi> we ſhould praiſe a ſecular Cauallier, for being much giuen to prayer, and diligent in the mortification of himſelfe, and full of feruour in <pb n="242" facs="tcp:23762:128"/>the exerciſe of vertue, and very obedient to his Ghoſtly Father. For we frame the reaſon after this manner; If a Lord or a Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, being a ſecular man, be of ſo great recollection, ſo great vertue, ſuch purity of life, ſuch diligence in the doing of good workes, his vocation not ſeeming to bind him altogether to it; how much more reaſon is it, that a Prelate make himſelfe a poſſeſſor of theſe vertues, whom his ſtate obligeth to be a perfect man; and a Religious perſon, whom his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion obligeth to procure to be perfectly vertuous?</p>
            <p>And ſo to reforme ſome very wiſe and learned man, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſpirit and deuotion, we may praiſe a man who is wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but yet full of the ſpirit of God, and of true deuotion ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If this rude creature hauing <pb n="243" facs="tcp:23762:128"/>ſo little knowledge of God, and of his workes, and myſteries, and being able to vſe ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of reaſon, haue yet ſo great loue of God, and ſo great feeling of his goodnes, and of his myſteries, and workes, &amp; ſo great guſt of diuine things, and maketh ſo great eſtimation of vertue, and ſpirituall bleſſings; how much more is it reaſon, that a wiſe and learned man, to whom God hath giuen ſo great wit, &amp; knowledge, for the comprehending of truth both diuine and humane, and ſo great light of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſcourſe, and paſſe by meanes of viſible thinges to the knowledge of ſuch as are inuiſible, and by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to come to the knowledge and loue of the Creatour, haue ſuch deuotion, as was ſaid before, or at leaſt procure to haue it?</p>
            <p>In this ſort did the Apoſtle S. <pb n="244" facs="tcp:23762:129"/>
               <hi>Paule,</hi> following this example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who were conuerted, for the moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertues which they had, and the admirable workes they did, and for thoſe moſt high gifts, which God had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them, by meanes of their faith; to the end that ſo the Iewes, who were in their infidelity, might know their errour, and be in confuſion, for their wickednes; and might be awaked by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Gentiles, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to the incitation thereof. This did he ſignify by ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>For as much as I am an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Gentiles,</hi> and during the whole time that I ſhall be ſo, <hi>I will honour this ministery,</hi> taking paines, and ſuffering for them, to bring them to the faith who are not yet come to it, and to confirme and perfect them with <pb n="245" facs="tcp:23762:129"/>vertues, and the gifts of God who haue already receiued it. And by this meanes, I will procure the conuerſion of the Iewes, who are of my kinred according to the fleſh, to the end that they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding the moſt abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant fruite which is produced in the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and the moſt pretious gifts which God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to them by meanes of their faith, <hi>may be moued to a holy emulation, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and ſo ſome of them may be ſaued.</hi>

            <head>THE XXI. CHAPTER. <hi>How wee are to praiſe the vertue of our neighbours, to defend them ſo, from ſome vniuſt ſlaunder.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ANother very iuſt reaſon, for which wee muſt praiſe our neighbours, and commend their <pb n="246" facs="tcp:23762:130"/>vertues, and good workes, is to defend them from ſome ſlaunder, or falſe teſtimony, or ſome detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or affront, wherewith their reputation is vniuſtly ſpotted, &amp; their good name and the opinion of their vertue obſcured. Let vs deliuer an example, which <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord left vs of this truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord being in <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> at ſupper in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the leaper, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>Matth.</hi>
26. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came with an Alablaſter box, full of very odoriferous and pretious ointment, &amp; ſhe anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the feet of our Lord with it, &amp; filled the whole houſe with the ſweet odour. Now
<hi>Iudas</hi> began to murmur at this worke, and to ſpeake ill of the holy woman, in that ſhe had waſted the ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which was of ſo great value, that it might haue bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſould for three hundred peeces of money, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:23762:130"/>been giuen to the poore. And the reſt of the diſciples, ſeeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and murmuringe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and not vnderſtanding the root of malice, from whence it grew, like good ſimple men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that he had reaſon, for what he ſaid; and were induced by his example, to murmur too, and to reproue that good worke, which <hi>Mary</hi> with ſo great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had done.</p>
            <p>Now our Lord ſaw well how the diſciples murmured againſt this holy woman, without all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; eſteeming that to be vitious, which was an act of vertue, and ſpeaking ill of that, which was well done. For being a cuſtome of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, as it was, to anoint the feet of their gueſts, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, if they were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men; it was no euill, but a good worke to doe that, which <pb n="248" facs="tcp:23762:131"/>was in vſe for ſome good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt end. For an indifferent actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch an one as this was, is made good by addreſſing it to a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous end. But then to this is to be added, the pure intention, and great deuotion, wherewith <hi>Mary</hi> did this worke: for ſhe did it as being moued by piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to exhibite honour and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to our Lord, whom ſhe knew to be worthy of all poſſible reuerence and reſpect.</p>
            <p>Our Lord therefore on the one ſide ſeeing the goodnes of the worke &amp; conſidering moreouer, the myſtery which himſelf me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſignify thereby, who had moued her to it; and on the other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the raſh iudgment &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of the diſciples, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of
<hi>Iudas,</hi> who was the ſpring of all that ill, he began to defend the woman, and to praiſe <pb n="249" facs="tcp:23762:131"/>the good worke which ſhe had wrought, and to diſcharge the ſlaunder, whereby they thought to doe her wrong; ſaying after this manner; <hi>Why are you trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to this woman?</hi> Why are you enraged againſt her? Why thinke and ſpeake you ill of her worke? leaue her free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your reproach, and giue her leaue to keep this ointment, for my buriall. His meaning was to ſay, the bodies of dead men, are according to our cuſtome, to be anointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be interred; and this woman would be glad to anoint my body, when I ſhall be dead; &amp; then will not be able, becauſe that office will be firſt performed by others, before I be buried; and after that buriall, ſhe ſhal be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by my reſurrection. But ſuffer her to doe that now, which ſhe would doe them; and that ſhe <pb n="250" facs="tcp:23762:132"/>may ſignify by this vnction that I am to dy; and that my body will be ſoon laid in the graue, and ſhe in the meane time, doth but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that office of piety, which is performed to other dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Our Lord ſaid further, <hi>she hath wrought a good worke towards mee;</hi> and it was conuenient that ſhee ſhould doe it although by doing it, the price of this ointment were thereby not giuen to the poore. For the poore you ſhall haue all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with you, and ſo ſhall you euer haue oportunity, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doe good to them: but as for mee, you ſhall not allwaies haue me with you, in this viſible forme; for I am quickly to leaue this world, and to goe to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I tell you for certaine, that in whatſoeuer part of the world, the good newes of this <pb n="251" facs="tcp:23762:132"/>Ghoſpell ſhall be preached, the worke of this woman ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and celebrated in her memory, and for her glory in all the parts of the world. And by theſe words did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord defend the
<hi>Magdalena,</hi> and praiſe her good worke.</p>
            <p>From this example we are firſt to fetch this fruite, to make great eſtimation of good workes, how little, how light, and how eaſy ſo euer they may be. How eaſy a thing is it, for a rich woman to buy a pound of pretious ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred peeces of ſiluer, and to anoint the feet of a holy man therwith; eſpecially of ſuch a Saint as <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord was? For in that he, who was anointed, was ſo great a Lord, the worke became more ſweet, and eaſy to be performed. Well then, ſo light and eaſy a worke as this, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <pb n="252" facs="tcp:23762:133"/>been performed by a perſon who was in the ſtate of grace, and with a pure intention, to ſerue and pleaſe Almighty God, was eſteemed ſo highly, as wee ſee by
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, and praiſed with ſuch Maieſty of wordes; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with ſuch a high reward, both in heauen and earth. Such value and dignity and excellency haue thoſe good workes, which are done for the loue of God.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Magdalena</hi> had ſpent, not three hundred peeces of ſiluer, but three hundred thouſand, in the ſeruice of the world, as in bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, and vaine dreſſings, in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and delitious bankets, and in making ſome feaſt, &amp; triumph to giue delight and guſt, as louers of the world are wont to doe; all that expence, had been loſt, and ſhe had not pleaſed Almighty God therby; nor had merited any <pb n="253" facs="tcp:23762:133"/>thing is his ſight; and there had been no honorable memory ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of continued amongſt men. And not reaping any profit by them, ſhee would haue incurred many faultes, as ordinarily there are, in theſe thinges, which would haue condemned her, either to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary paines of Purgatory, or els to the eternall torments of hell. But now, for hauing ſpent a little money vpon the ſeruice of <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, and for vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going that light &amp; ſweet labour, in performing that work of piety, with her owne hands, ſhe pleaſed Almighty God ſo much, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited ſo greatly in his ſight, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo much honour through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, that as long as it laſts, ſhe ſhall be praiſed, &amp; had in veneration for this worke, by all faithfull Chriſtians; and for all eternity ſhall be made happy
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:23762:134"/>amongſt the Angells in heauen, with a moſt high crown of glory. And ſo will that be fulfilled which was ſaid by the wiſe man;
<hi>The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of iuſt perſons wil remaine amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst men, after their death,</hi> and they ſhall relate their heroicall deedes, and exhibite praiſe, and veneration to them; whereas the memory and fame of wicked perſons, ſhall be full of reproach, and it ſhall periſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are to draw from this example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, that when wee ſee vertuous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuffer hurt in their reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or good name, whereby their neighbours were to be edified, &amp; whereof they are depriued, by the ſlaunders, and lies of wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wee muſt defend them by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing teſtimony to the truth, and by praiſing their good life. And when men murmur againſt them <pb n="255" facs="tcp:23762:134"/>in our preſence, wee muſt excuſe their innocency, &amp; declare their vertue. And if it ſo fall out, that we haue any credit with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers; we muſt procure to mend them, and ſtop the diſcourſe; and if our aduice by way of ſpeech will not ſerue, we muſt ſhew both by our ſilence, and by our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that ſuch murmuring is diſpleaſing to vs. This is that which the holy Ghoſt doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh ſaying, that as the ſharpe cold winde coming from the North, hindreth raine, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not, through the coldnes thereof, that the cloudes ſhould eaſily diſſolue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo doth the reſerued and ſad countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of him who heareth, ty vp the tongue of the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. This ſaith the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> in the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> who was inſtructed by the Holy Ghoſt. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <pb n="256" facs="tcp:23762:135"/>is, becauſe when the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſees, that they who heare him looke cheerfully vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he thinkes he pleaſeth them, &amp; that they giue him a glad eare; and he taketh ſo much the more heart, and liberty to murmur: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he findeth, that they ſhew him an ill countenance, he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds by that, that the diſcourſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not; but that they are vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare it, &amp; this he markes, and ſo he begines to giue ouer murmuring.</p>

            <head>THE XXII. CHAPTER. <hi>How wee ought to praiſe wiſe men, when they are vertuous, to the end that others may profit by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and doctrine.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEſides thoſe reaſons before expreſſed, there is yet an
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:23762:135"/>other of great force, why wee ought to praiſe the ſeruants of God; and it is, to the end that our neighbours hauing notice of their vertue and parts, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more, both by their doctrine, and by the example of their life. This praiſe belongeth chiefly, to perſons who are much knowne, and haue authority, or publicke office, as Prelates, Iudges, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſors, Religious men, Prieſts, and rich and noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for vpon the vertue, &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and wiſdome of ſuch as theſe (who are as the heads, and hearts) dependeth the vertue of the people: and ſo the good life, and incorrupt doctrine of theſe ſeruants of God, being generally knowne, and commended, the reſt of men doth profit by it ſo much the more, and are more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their good ſpeeches, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:23762:136"/>vertuous examples; and therfore to praiſe ſuch perſons, with that diſcretion which is fit, is a thing very acceptable to God, and very profitable for the gaining of ſoules. Let vs relate an example, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord gaue vs hereof.</p>
            <p>The diſciples of Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> came to
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord in their Maſters name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.
<hi>Luc.</hi> 7. to know if he were that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was to come; that is to ſay, if he were the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> who had been promiſed by Almighty God, for the ſaluation of the world. And our Lord hauing anſwered this queſtion, by the workes he did, which was by working the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which were prophecied of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and by preaching that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which belonged to him to teach, and publiſh, he diſpatched them away ſaying; <hi>Tell Iohn what <pb n="259" facs="tcp:23762:136"/>you haue and heard.</hi> When the diſciples of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> were gone, our Lord began to celebrate the diuine praiſes of the ſame Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to proclame his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vertues, ſaying; <hi>What went you out to ſee in the deſert? Went you perhaps to ſee ſome reed, or cane, which is shaken with euery winde? or ſome man ſet forth in ſoft, and delicate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell?</hi> He mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as followeth; you went not out to ſee a light, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant perſon, who is mooued by euery paſſion, or intereſt; but a moſt conſtant man, and who perſeuereth with admirable reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in the truth, which he preacheth; and in that holy life which he began to lead. And you ſhall euidently ſee, that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and light perſons, who are mooued with paſſions, or by the intereſts of this world, be allwaies in loue with regaloes, and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <pb n="260" facs="tcp:23762:137"/>in their food, their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and their habitation, and are deſirous of wealth, and haue recourſe to the houſes of great men, where theſe things are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in abundance. But in <hi>Iohn,</hi> you ſhall ſee nothing of this, but a life of great penance and auſterity, &amp; very abſtinent, &amp; eſtranged from all manner of regalo, and wholly depriued &amp; deſtitute of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods. For his habitation, is in the dry and horrid deſert: his bed, is the hard ground: his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſharpe hairecloth, made of camells haire: his food is dry locuſts: his drinke running water; and his continuall exerciſe, is to pray, and contemplate in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and to baptiſe and preach penance, in the riuer of <hi>Iordan.</hi> He ſaith moreouer of him;
<hi>And what went you out to ſee in the deſert?</hi> Was it <hi>perhaps ſome Prophet? Verely <pb n="261" facs="tcp:23762:137"/>I ſay to you, that he is more then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. For this is he, of whom the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father ſaid, whileſt he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſonne, as is recorded in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachias; Behould I ſend my Angell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy preſence, to prepare the way for thee. I tell you for a moſt certaine truth, that there was not borne of woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a greater, then Iohn the Baptiſt; but yet he, who is the leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is greater then hee.</hi> Which ſignifieth, according to the beſt expoſition; He who for his age, &amp; the office of humility which he exerciſeth, and in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the people is the pooreſt member of the Church, (which was our Lord himſelfe the true <hi>Meſsias</hi>) is both in dignity, and ſanctity, greater then he.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had preached pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the people, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men to the exerciſe of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and had giuen expreſſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <pb n="262" facs="tcp:23762:138"/>mony of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he was the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> And now, to the end, that by ſending this meſſage, whereby they asked of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord,
<hi>if he were the Meſsias,</hi> the people might not ſuſpect that he made any doubt, as ſome inconſtant might doe, of that which formerly he had teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and of that which now he queſtioned, but only in regard both of his owne diſciples, and of al that people (that ſo they might forſake the ignorance, wherein they were, &amp; remain more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their faith; &amp; not thinke that he demaunded it in regard of the ignorance wherein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was) for this reaſon, did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord extoll him afterward, with ſo illuſtrious praiſes, and teſtified with ſo great aſſeueratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the conſtancy and purity of his life, and the eminency of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <pb n="263" facs="tcp:23762:138"/>and dignity. And he proued this, both by the experience of what they ſawe, and by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony alſo of a Prophet: to the end that they might be ſettled in the great belief, which they ought to haue of his truth, and ſanctity; and that ſo, they might profit by the doctrine, which he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the example of life which he had ſhewed.</p>
            <p>In this ſort are wee to praiſe men for their vertues, after the example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their life and doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the good of the faithfull, to the end that their wordes of counſell, may be more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and their example more profitable to all men.

            <head>THE XXIII. CHAPTER. <hi>Of the rule which wee are to hold, when vpon the aforeſaid reaſon, we shall praiſe the ſeruants of God.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BVt in affoarding this praiſe, wee muſt obſerue theſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and rules of diſcretion. That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we praiſe another man, not to the end of encouraging him, or moouing him to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and proceeding in vertue, or for the perſwading him to the doing of ſome good worke, but for the good, and profit of others, that ſo his vertue and wiſdome being knowne, and much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his neighbours, who heare, <pb n="267" facs="tcp:23762:141"/>and diſcourſe thereof, may profit by his example, inſtruction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and gouernment (which is the caſe wherof we are ſpeaking;) we muſt not then praiſe the party in his own preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor yet before his familiar friends, who already know his parts, and who are likely to tell him what they haue heard; but onely before ſuch others, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it may concerne to know his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and parts, to take profit by him. So did <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he praiſed Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> for he did it in his abſence; and he ſtaied for the doing of it, till the diſciples of Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> were gone.</p>
            <p>This rule muſt wee alſo hold, that ſo we may take from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, whom we praiſe, all occaſion of vaine complacence, and eſtimation of himſelfe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the praiſes happen to be great, in reſpect that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <pb n="268" facs="tcp:23762:142"/>vertues, and parts are greatly worthy to be praiſed. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, that many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, who haue laid the rootes of humility very deeply in their hearts, and who, by long experience and much light from heauen, haue wel vnderſtood and penetrated the weakenes of man, are free from this danger, &amp; take no occaſion of vanity by it, but contemne themſelues ſo much the more; yet this is not euery bodies caſe. How ſoeuer we ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that it happened in the caſe of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> when once a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell (ſpeaking by the mouth of a poſſeſt perſon) had a minde to cry out thus aloud, <hi>Ambroſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mee;</hi> For then the Saint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the diuells craft, &amp; what he pretended by praiſing him. But he did not onely not growe <pb n="269" facs="tcp:23762:142"/>proud by occaſion thereof, but he humiliated himſelfe ſo much the more, and ſaid; <hi>Hold thy peace, thou diuell, for it is not Ambroſe who torments thee, but the faith of the Saints in God, and thine owne enuy. Know that Ambroſe will not growe proud, vpon thy praiſes.</hi> This paſſed with Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the like happened to Saint <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the Abbot. For this man, had a gift from God, to caſt out diuells; and they brought diuers poſſeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to him; and the diuells deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by their infernall craft, to hoiſe vp the Saint, into pride with praiſe, they cried out thus aloud, <hi>Marcellus, doe thou commaund vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of theſe bodies, for thou hast power ouer vs;</hi> and this they repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated often. The Saint vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the malice of the diuells, &amp; would not ſend them out vpon their commaundme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; but taking <pb n="270" facs="tcp:23762:143"/>occaſion from that ſpeech, to humble him ſelfe ſo much the more, and lifting vp his eyes to heauen, he begged of
<hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, that he would caſt them out ſaying thus; <hi>O Lord, preſerue this worke of thy hands;</hi> &amp; he continued praying ſo long, that the diuells departed out of the bodies.</p>
            <p>Though this be ſo, and that many great ſeruants of God, are ſettled ſo firmely, and ſolidly in the truth of humility, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane praiſes moue them not at all, but rather they humiliate themſelues the more by occaſion thereof; yet there are others, who though indeed they be the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God and haue very excellent vertues, and gifts from heauen, and are worthy to be praiſed; yet notwithſtanding they haue ſome weaknes this way, and are ſubiect to the danger of growing proud <pb n="271" facs="tcp:23762:143"/>vpon humane praiſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are praiſed much. And this is the vſuall caſe, and which ordinarily happeneth, that euen good men are ſubiect to this weaknes, and are expoſed to this danger. And a man may clearly ſee, what force thoſe praiſes haue to make men giddy, &amp; how much occaſion they miniſter of making them fall into vaine complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and pride. Firſt, in that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells, who are ſo great and wiſe Maſters in doing ill, did take the meanes of praiſing, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the power which Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and Saint <hi>Marcellus</hi> had ouer them from Almighty God, as the likelieſt way to make them fal into pride. And this truth may bee alſo ſeene, by the great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which the Saints haue euer vſed, in flying from the praiſes of men, for the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger which they <pb n="272" facs="tcp:23762:144"/>knew to be therein, and the feare they had to fall thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surius</hi> doth relate in the life of the bleſſed and moſt holy man <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was a Prior of <hi>Chanons Regular;</hi> that fearing the danger of praiſe, he fled from it after an extraordinary manner. He went to do a certaine office of charity, to certaine woemen the ſeruants of God, who were retired from the world; and one of them, who was there ſhut vp, receaued a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation</hi> of his going thither; and therein, our Lord had declared to them, the great ſanctity and merit of that ſeruant of his. Now there was here no neceſſity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that reuelation in praiſe of his ſanctity: for it was not made to her for the profit of the Saint, but to the end that they might profit by his coming thither, ſo much the more, by how much <pb n="273" facs="tcp:23762:144"/>more they were certified of his ſanctity. And therefore, as ſoon as the Saint heard her begin to ſpeake thereof, he found that there was danger of conceiuing ſome vaine complacence, or eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe; and it troubled him much to heare ſuch praiſes of his vertue; and he made her a quicke anſwere, and concluding the buſines in few wordes, went imediatly away. For the danger that he found, to heare humane praiſe, made him reſolue not to ſtay, where there was ſo great eſtimation of the holy manner of his life.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>William,</hi> who of Duke of <hi>Aquitania,</hi> came to be a moſt holy Monke, and a Father of many Monkes, was much praiſed by men, for his many vertues, &amp; the great miracles which he wrought. This put him to extreme paine, <pb n="274" facs="tcp:23762:145"/>and he would faine haue auoided the working of miracles, through the feare he had of being praiſed. And
<hi>Theobaldus</hi> the Biſhop, ſaith in his life; That in regard he was not able to e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dure humane praiſe, he went into a ſolitary place, &amp; and betooke himſelfe there to a little cottage in company of a diſciple of his, doing penance there, and leading a celeſtial life, till he made a moſt holy end.</p>
            <p>The Saints therfore haue well vnderſtood; the danger which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily there is in human praiſe; eſpecially when they are giuen with great honour, and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſanctity. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when we praiſe the ſeruants of God, for the benefit of others, wee are to doe it, if wee can, in their abſence.</p>
            <p>Wee are alſo to doe ſo, for an other reaſon, which is, to ſecure <pb n="275" facs="tcp:23762:145"/>our ſelues from the note and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of being flatterers. For when wee praiſe our neighbour, for the profit of his ſoule, namely to deliuer him from puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and to animate him to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the neceſſity which then ther is of praiſing him in his preſence, will free vs from being ſuſpected to doe it out of flattery: but when wee praiſe him for the good of others, if wee doe it without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in his preſence, it draweth the ſuſpicion of flattery with it; and therefore as much as we may, wee muſt procure to giue ſuch praiſe in abſence. And this alſo did <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord teach vs, in this praiſe of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> For vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this reaſon, he ſtaied till the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Saint were gone, to auoid all ſuſpicion of flattery. So ſaid Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> Therefore did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord praiſe Saint <pb n="276" facs="tcp:23762:146"/>
               <hi>Iohn,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his diſciples were gone, that ſo it might not ſeeme to be flattery.</p>

            <head>THE XXIV. CHAPTER. <hi>Of other rules which wee must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue when wee praiſe men: that is, that wee praiſe ſome, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to others: and that wee doe it in moderate words.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ANother rule which wee are to obſerue in theſe praiſes, is to praiſe ſome in ſuch ſorte, as that we giue no offence to others, by diminiſhing the vertues and parts of ſome, to encreaſe thoſe of other folkes. And therefore we muſt procure as much as we may, not to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſons between ſome and others; telling the faultes of this man, and the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of that other; abaſing and <pb n="277" facs="tcp:23762:146"/>vilifying ſome, and exalting and magnifying other men; and of this we muſt eſpecially take heed, when they of whom wee ſpeake, are aliue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord gaue vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this rule, in the praiſe which he vttered of Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> for he ſaid not of him that he was <hi>the greatest of all them who had been borne of woemen; but that no man had been borne before that time, greater then hee;</hi> thereby leauing men in liberty, to thinke that others, might be equall to him. And out of this general ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he brought that exception which was fit, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>that the leaſt of the kingdome of heauen was greater then he.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome vnderſtand thereby the leaſt of the Angells, who are bleſſed in heauen; yet the more certaine expoſition is (as we haue ſaid before) that he vnderſtood <pb n="278" facs="tcp:23762:147"/>him who was <hi>the leaſt,</hi> by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is, that Saint of Saints; and he who is the fountaine of all ſanctity, of whom Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> himſelfe ſaid, <hi>that he was not worthy to vntie the latchet of his shoo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee alſo muſt follow this rule of prudence in praiſing men, who are praiſe worthy. For if we praiſe men for the loue of God, &amp; being moued by charity as wee ought; the ſame charity will tell vs, that we muſt doe it without offending any body, and that ſo wee muſt comfort, and honour ſome with our praiſe, as that wee doe not offend, or diſpraiſe others by ſleighting their vertues.</p>
            <p>The laſt rule which wee are to hold is that wee praiſe men, euen although they be Saints, with moderation, and temperance, &amp; in modeſt wordes; in ſuch ſorte that wee exceed not the limits, <pb n="279" facs="tcp:23762:147"/>either of truth, or of neceſſity, by our enforcing, or exaggeration thereof. For if wee praiſe a man, either to make him friendly, or to animate him to the doing of good, or to perſwade him to the beleefe of any truth, or to the practiſe of any vertue, or to gaine credit for him with other folkes; it will be fit to ſpeake ſo well of him as is neceſſary, for the obtaining of that end, which is pretended, &amp; to worke that good effect which is deſired; and this is ſufficient, laying other praiſes and exaggerations aſide, which neither are neceſſary, nor profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the edification of others.</p>
            <p>This moderation which wee ought to vſe in praiſing men, is taught vs by the holy Scripture ſaying, <hi>doe not praiſe a man, till he be dead.</hi> He doth not here prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite all praiſe of ſuch as liue; for
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:23762:148"/>it is clearly lawful, and neceſſary, and pleaſing to God, to praiſe men, whileſt they liue, as we haue declared already; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe ſaith; <hi>The faithfull man, shall be much praiſed.</hi> But he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that wee muſt not praiſe ſuch as are ſtill liuing, with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect praiſe, as if they were ſecure, and confirmed in the ſtate of grace, as they are to be, in heauen. And ſo that, <hi>doe not praiſe,</hi> doth ſignify as the Greeke letter ſheweth; <hi>do not beatify or pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame any man for bleſſed before his death:</hi> which ſentence grew into this Prouerbe; <hi>Let no man cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe happy before he dy.</hi> And therfore wee are admoniſhed by this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, not to praiſe any man, as abſolutely bleſſed, or entirely happy in this life: but when was ſay <hi>he is happy,</hi> wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it with this condition or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; <pb n="281" facs="tcp:23762:148"/>that he is happy accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent iuſtice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he liues; or happy according to his preſent ſtate and diſpoſition: and, in fine, that he is happy in hope. For as long as a man liueth, it is euer fit for him to be affraid of falling, and to be in doubt of perſeuering. Yet this takes not from vs, but that wee may praiſe good men; but onely that our praiſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be moderate, as of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who may faile in the courſe of vertue, wherin they are; &amp; may fall vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſinne in which they are not; til the good e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of a happy death, doe ſecure their vertue, &amp; ratify their good life. This did S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> declare in theſe words; <hi>He is not inſtantly happy, who hath now no ſinne in his ſoule; for it is not ſaid without cauſe, that we muſt praiſe no man before his death.</hi> And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that whileſt a man liues, he <pb n="282" facs="tcp:23762:149"/>may faile; and therefore till he dy, he muſt not be celebrated with any praiſe, as determinate and certaine, and which cannot be reuoked. He, who after the end of a good life, hath died well, may be iuſtly termed happy: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready he enioyeth the ſociety of the bleſſed, with a ſecurity, which is perfect.</p>

            <head>THE XXV. CHAPTER. <hi>Of the rules, which they are to keepe, who are praiſed; that ſo they may be at no preiudice, but receiue profit thereby.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THey who praiſe others, are to obſerue thoſe rules, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue ſpoken. Let vs now ſay ſomewhat, of the rules which are to be kept by them, who are prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; remitting the reſt to ſome
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:23762:149"/>other place.</p>
            <p>The firſt rule is, that a man (for as much as concernes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that is to ſay, his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, his eſtimation and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) muſt not deſire or ſeeke the praiſe of men. For to deſire praiſe vpon theſe reaſons, and for this end is a vaine and vitious thing, which ſpotteth, and defileth the heart of man, and diſquieteth and diſturbeth it, and maketh it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to euery change. For as all human thinges are ſubiect to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; and one man praiſeth, and another man diſpraiſeth; one exalteth, and another abaſeth; one honoureth, and another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureth his neighbour: from hence it groweth, that the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable heart, which loueth praiſe, is now cheerfull, and then ſad; now refreſhed &amp; them diſmaied; and neuer doth enioy ſtrength or
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:23762:150"/>reſt. On the other a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who cares not for the praiſes of men, but deſpiſeth and auoides them; and, for his part, deſireth onely to be approoued, and praiſed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whoſe iudgment is right, and vpon whoſe approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and praiſe, our ſaluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, and who contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with this teſtimony, doth proceed like a iuſt man, who lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth true iuſtice, and not vanity; and ſo keepes his heart quiet, and firmely ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goodnes, becauſe he reſteth himſelf vpon God, who is not ſubiect to any change. So ſaith Saint
<hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is delighted with the praiſes of men, and though he haue not the vertue, for which he is praiſed, yet he holds his peace, and is glad of it. But the iuſt man flies from praiſe, and though he haue that vertue for <pb n="285" facs="tcp:23762:150"/>which they praiſe him, &amp; though he know thereby, that he who praiſed him, ſaid true; yet ſtill he hath no minde to be praiſed. And in another place, the ſame Saint ſaith; Nothing makes men ſo vaine, and light, as the appetite of glory, &amp; of the praiſe of men, and ſo nothing maketh them ſo firme and conſtant, and ſtrong, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of all the honour, and praiſe of this world.</p>
            <p>But now ſince it is not lawfull to like the praiſes of men for his owne honour, and temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; let vs ſee, whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to like, and deſire them for the animating, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging himſelfe thereby, to the exerciſe of vertue. We ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay firſt, that this may bee lawfull in ſome caſe, and with ſome moderation; as namely for a man, who is in affliction, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation <pb n="286" facs="tcp:23762:151"/>to deſire that men may comfort him; putting him in minde of the good he hath done, or of the fruite which hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vpon his actions, or by his example or inſtruction: that ſo he may not be diſmaied with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and if he be diſmaied, that he may take heart: not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of that praiſe with any meaning to dwell therein; but as a receipt of phyſicke, wherewith to cure his infirmity, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and to induce himſelfe the better to ſerue God, for what God is, and for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his holy will. As King <hi>Ezechias</hi> did, who being in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of ſicknes, and much afflicted with the approach of death, did for the increaſe of his confidence in God, and for the comfort of his ſoule, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of his deſolation, comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:23762:151"/>to God himſelf, the good deedes he had done, ſaying thus; I beſeech thee, ô Lord remember how I haue liued, and conuerſed before thee, with truth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hypocriſy or diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; &amp; how in all things which concerned thy Religion, I haue ſerued thee with the intire affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my heart; not honouring any other God, but thee, who art the true God; and how I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed theſe good workes which thou haſt commaunded. In this ſort the good afflicted King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that all the good things which he had done, were the gifts of God, and referring them all to him, reduced them to his memory, and preſented them before almighty God; not reſting and relying vpon them; but vpon the mercy and grace of God; by meanes whereof he had wrought <pb n="288" facs="tcp:23762:152"/>them: &amp; he did it to the end that he might erect himſelfe to ſome good hope; and to comfort his ſad heart. And ſo it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for an afflicted man, with the ſame intention, and to the ſame end, to like and accept of being aſſiſted by this meanes of the pious, and confortable ſpeech of his neighbour.</p>
            <p>Secondly we ſay, that although this manner of praiſe may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted with this modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet it is not conuenient to deſire, or procure it; becauſe there are many better meanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, whereby to be animated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to vertue; and by reaſon of danger which there is, in louing humane praiſe, and the honour which growes therby; and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king value, and taking compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in himſelfe, and ſo grow to do well for the honours ſake. And <pb n="289" facs="tcp:23762:152"/>becauſe this inconuenience and hurt groweth ordinarily vpon them who deſire to be praiſed for this end; Saint
<hi>Gregory</hi> conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes it, ſaying; It as a thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to arrogant perſons, and giuen to vanity, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be animated to doe well, by the praiſes of others. And preachers and inſtructers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who for this reaſon deſire praiſe, are diſmaied, when they are not praiſed; and being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious louers of humane honour and fauour, they will defend and excuſe themſelues ſaying, that it is lawfull for them to deſire it, for the good which they receiue by humane praiſe; and for this, they ſhew their abilities, and will be praiſed for them, to the end that by meanes of this praiſe, they may growe more in vertue. Whereby certainly they deceiue <pb n="290" facs="tcp:23762:153"/>themſelues, and ſo by meanes of this errour, that diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in them, by which they loue and deſire the praiſe of men. But the true ſeruants of God, are free from this vanity; for although they labour by their vertues, to equal the praiſes, wherewith men celebrate the ſame, yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to be praiſed by men, but they deſpiſe praiſe, with their heart; and for aſmuch as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth themſelues they flie from it with great earneſtnes. Thus ſaith Saint
<hi>Gregory.</hi> Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth clearly, that it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, for the end of profiting our ſelues, to deſire the praiſe of men, by reaſon of the deceit, and danger which lyeth hid therein, that wee may not perhaps doe it for any true neceſſity, but for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and not for the true profit of our ſoules, but to the preiudice <pb n="291" facs="tcp:23762:153"/>thereof.</p>
            <p>The intention &amp; end for which wee may lawfully deſire, or admit of praiſe, is for the good of our neighbours; to the end that by the conceit, and good opinion, which they haue of our life and doctrine, they may grow the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by vs; edifying themſelues by our good example, and inducing themſelues to the loue of vertue, by meanes of our aduice and counſelle, or of our gouernment, or doctrine. So ſaith the glorious Saint
<hi>Augustine.</hi> He who worketh according to vertue deſireth not praiſe: but yet praiſe ought to follow him, who worketh well; to the end that it may profit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who praiſe, by encouraging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the vertues, which they praiſe. But howſoeuer it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to deſire praiſe for this end, becauſe in this caſe, it is not <pb n="292" facs="tcp:23762:154"/>praiſe which is loued and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the profit of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; yet the better and more ſecure way, and that which hath been vſed by the Saints, is; not to procure or deſire, euen for this very end, to be praiſed by men; nor that men ſhould publiſh his vertues and celebrate him for the ſame, leaſt ſome vanity or othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> giue it ſelfe to his ſoule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but that he leaue it to Gods prouidence, that ſo he may doe therein, as he ſhall thinke moſt fit, and deſiring (for as much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes himſelf) that he be not praiſed.</p>
            <p>The thing which he is to doe, is that he labour hard, and bee watchfull in doing good &amp; holy workes; &amp; in giuing good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all thinges, and vſing holy diſcourſe, &amp; teaching ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and giuing wholſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and deſiring, that the men <pb n="293" facs="tcp:23762:154"/>who ſhall happen to ſee his good workes, and to heare his good wordes, may be ſtirred vp to know, that God is the Author of them, and may praiſe him for them, and be induced to ſerue him, performing not onely thoſe workes which he doth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, but others which may be much better. And when he ſhall find or vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that men praiſe him, for what he doth, let him enter into his owne heart, and deſpiſe himſelfe through the knowledge he hath of his ſinnes; for which he deſerueth all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and let him hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnworthy of ſuch praiſe, for hauing offended God, who was the principall Author of thoſe good workes. And let him deſire, that men, forgetting or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, as he deſerueth, may giue the praiſe and glory of thoſe <pb n="294" facs="tcp:23762:155"/>good workes of God. To this are wee aduiſed by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in theſe wordes. The praiſe which is giuen to a iuſt man, for the good he doth, he muſt inſtantly referre to God; deſiring that his diuine Maieſty, who is the Authour of that good worke, may be praiſed for it; for the men who are good, haue not their being ſo, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but from God. And when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiſe vs, let vs reforme thoſe praiſes, giuing all to God, who gaue vs that goodnes, which is praiſed by men. And in an other place, the ſame Saint ſaith, when thou ſhalt be praiſed, deſpiſe thy ſelfe, and deſire that he may be praiſed in thee, who worketh in thee, the good thou doeſt; and ſo thou muſt not doe good thinges for thine owne praiſe, but for the praiſe of that Lord, of whom thou didſt receiue the good thou doeſt. <pb n="295" facs="tcp:23762:155"/>And heerwith wee will conclude the rules which are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, both by ſuch as praiſe, and ſuch as are praiſed.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo will wee conclude our diſcourſe, concerning thoſe thinges which belong to the moſt ſweet vertue of
<hi>Benignity,</hi> and which in ſumme are theſe. To do good to our neighbours with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, &amp; with a willing minde; To graunt them with eaſe, what they aske; To condeſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to them in things lawfull; To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fably and ſweetly; and both in countenance and wordes, to be cheerfull; To indure meekly the defects of others; To reprehend them with loue; To pardon them with mercy; To impoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundments vpon ſuch as are ſubiect, which they may obey with guſt; and to impoſe burdens on them which they may carry <pb n="296" facs="tcp:23762:156"/>with eaſe; To be curteous and wel mannered; And to praiſe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of others for the comfort, &amp; edification and ſpiritual profit of our neighbours.</p>
            <p>By the practiſe of this vertue, wee ſhall growe moſt like to God, who is moſt <hi>Benigne;</hi> and we ſhall become acceptable to his moſt pitteous heart, and moreouer we ſhall prooue pleaſing and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good men, for their edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; &amp; more tolerable to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, for the conuerſion and winning of their ſoules to God. And hereby wee ſhall alſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify thoſe inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in vs, which are contrary to
<hi>Benignity,</hi> and ſo obtaine victory ouer our ſelues; and we ſhall exerciſe many moſt excellent acts of other vertues, which carry relation, and reſpect to <hi>Benignity;</hi> and wee ſhall obtaine great peace &amp; quietnes of heart, <pb n="297" facs="tcp:23762:156"/>wherby we may the better be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to communicate with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, by meanes of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Contemplation.</p>
            <p>And finally, if wee will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>Benignity</hi> towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, we ſhall haue more

               </gap> experience of the
<hi>Benignity</hi> of God, through the abundant gift of ſpiritual graces and comforts, which he will impart to vs. And aboue all thinges, wee ſhall be enabled heerby, to performe his holy wil; therby doing that which he comaundeth vs, by his Bleſſed Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Be you Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne one towards another; Be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hauing compaſsion of one anothers miſery; and pardoning all iniuries to one another, in ſuch ſort as God hath pardoned vs, by the vertue and merit of Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
